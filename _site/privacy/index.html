<p>4.1.Ascential may use your personal information (subject in each case to the requirements of the DPA) for the following purposes:</p>
<ol>
  <li>
    <p>administering your website account(s) and otherwise in connection with any service for which you have provided your information, including any email alerts, transactions with us and competitions and promotions that you take part in;</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>responding to any enquiry you make;</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>subject to your consent, sending you newsletters and/or alerts and information regarding Ascential’s or any third party’s future services (in all formats to which you have consented e.g. post, email, text); and</p>

    <p>to any service providers, sub-contractors and agents appointed by Ascential to perform the above functions on its behalf and in accordance with its instructions;</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>to third parties selected by Ascential as part of aggregated and anonymised statistics about users, traffic patterns etc. of the Ascential website(s);</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>to such individuals and/or bodies as necessary to ensure Ascential’s compliance with any applicable law, regulation, legal proceeding or governmental request;</p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>to any individual making a subject information request to Ascential.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>if you allow your visitor badge to be scanned by an exhibitor or sponsor when at the event, you will be providing the exhibitor or sponsor with your personal data, which they may use to contact you about their products or services and may transfer this data outside of the European Economic Area for these purposes.</p>
