&lt;p&gt;It does this through its website offer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Founder Piers Johnson explains the process they went through:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;wish-list&quot;&gt;Wish list…&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Both founders have experience in creating and establishing websites in a variety of industries.  When bringing that experience to retail, the first step was to create a wish list of criteria for what they wanted from the website.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;search-and-match&quot;&gt;Search and match…&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They then looked for an existing platform provider that best met this, selecting Big Commerce.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;choice-and-set-up&quot;&gt;Choice and set up…&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The big challenges were making the right choices with third party providers, such as payment processing systems, banking partners and then managing the set up processes for each.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;last-minute-challenges&quot;&gt;Last-minute challenges…&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We had to change our payment processing partners just before launch due to misinterpretation of service and processes. In addition, setting up all the product lines in the back end was another mammoth job to complete.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;his-top-tip&quot;&gt;His top tip…&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Work with partners. Wherever possible work with partners and experts, calling in favours and advice, as going it alone will be a daunting experience.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="ecommerce" /><summary>Founded early 2014, and named after the owners’ favourite French town Aubeterre Blue was created with a vision to provide everything for successful home entertaining from a perfectly laid table, a well-dressed room or a garden party.</summary></entry><entry><title>From Recession to Success</title><link href="http://inside-retail.garethjohnsdesign.com/articles/from-recession-to-success/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="From Recession to Success" /><published>2016-07-18T15:47:00+00:00</published><updated>2016-07-18T15:47:00+00:00</updated><id>http://inside-retail.garethjohnsdesign.com/articles/from-recession-to-success</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://inside-retail.garethjohnsdesign.com/articles/from-recession-to-success/">&lt;p&gt;After nearly 25 years in the food industry Anne Wright followed her passion for fashion and took over an ailing indie fashion retailing business in her home town.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Just then, the recession hit…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;…now she is an award-winning independent premium and womenswear retailer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;annes-story&quot;&gt;ANNE’S STORY&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Young Ideas was an established womenswear shop that I’d known for a long time. The owner had been running it since the late 60’s and it had a small but loyal customer base and great staff.
But it had run out of steam and wasn’t winning new, younger customers to replace the older ones.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even though I wasn’t starting a business from scratch, it felt that way because I came from the food industry. Although that meant I was used to dealing with retailers and understood the importance of new product, it’s very different from running a small business.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I learnt very quickly that you are at the sharp end because it’s your own money. You have to make all the decisions that matter. 
I bought Young Ideas in 2008 and unfortunately the recession began at the end of that year. Business just melted away. Customers couldn’t or wouldn’t spend.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Looking back, I think it forced us to look even harder at the business and to understand it better. It meant we had to work very, very hard but the business today is very different and much stronger.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A key lesson is that you have to completely immerse yourself in the business to understand it. This is absolutely essential for a fashion business which depends on forward ordering. I needed to be involved in everything for at least 18 months so that I could understand what customers wanted, how they were buying and who they were.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/uploads/gs-rom-recession-to-success-young-ideas-2.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;gs-rom-recession-to-success-young-ideas-2.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is absolutely essential to know your customers if you are going to survive as an independent retailer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The recession also brought with it opportunities. In 2011, we opened a new store in Derby city centre in a good location and  low overhead, and we were beginning to feel confident about the brand portfolio.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our next big move was forced upon us when we tried and failed buy the freehold for the original shop in Ashbourne. We knew the lease was near the end of its life when we bought the business in 2008. When the landlord wouldn’t negotiate we started looking at other options.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The big leap of faith was when my husband and I decided that the empty but iconic coaching inn at the heart of Ashbourne offered a great opportunity to refurbish and redevelop.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Young Ideas relocated in 2013 to a bigger shop and we have been redeveloping the site in different phases. We added menswear to our portfolio and we now have smaller units in the courtyard and we will be adding a restaurant in time. The business is now doing very well, has tripled since 2008.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/uploads/gs-rom-recession-to-success-young-ideas-3.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;gs-rom-recession-to-success-young-ideas-3.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;annes-key-lessons&quot;&gt;ANNE’S KEY LESSONS&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;know-your-customer&quot;&gt;1 Know your customer&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Capture data on your customers all the time. When I bought the business, we had around 500 names of customers but the list hadn’t been refreshed for some time. Everyone at Young Ideas knows that they have to add new customers to our mailing lists. We now have over 7,000 names and many of them are regular customers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;immerse-yourself-in-the-business&quot;&gt;2 Immerse yourself in the business&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you are responsible for the buying, then this is even more essential. It is the only way you get to understand who you are buying for.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;you-have-to-take-online-seriously&quot;&gt;3 You have to take online seriously&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Your customers may not always buy from your site, but they will go to it for information and to see what products are new in store.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;buy-for-your-customers-and-not-yourself&quot;&gt;4 Buy for your customers and not yourself&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt; I think about the different groups of customers we have and try to categorise them which makes me focus my buying.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;invest-in-a-good-retail-management-system&quot;&gt;5 Invest in a good retail management system&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt; It is essential to know what you have in stock and what you have sold. Cash flow and understanding cash flow is probably the biggest single lesson that every small retailer has to learn.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;create-excitement&quot;&gt;6 Create excitement&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We have always run events to get closer to our customers. Running events such as fashion shows is a big investment but was a powerful way of getting customers into the shop.&lt;/p&gt;

But, says, Martin Newman, founder and CEO of retail consultancy Practicology, thanks to your speed and agility, you have the opportunity to out-maneuvre your larger counterparts.       Still, there is a lot to consider. Here, Martin gives us his checklist for online success:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;whats-the-customer-convenience-proposition&quot;&gt;1 WHAT’S THE CUSTOMER CONVENIENCE PROPOSITION?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt; What delivery and returns options will you offer? Will you charge for these or offer them free? Think about what you sell, what your average order values are and what your competitors do.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;will-you-offer-click-and-collect&quot;&gt;2 WILL YOU OFFER CLICK AND COLLECT?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt; You’ll convert more customers, and you’ll be able to sell them more products when they come into your store to pick up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;product-range&quot;&gt;3 PRODUCT RANGE&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt; The web provides the opportunity to offer different products. You might decide to go down what we call the long tail route and extend the range by offering more options that you don’t sell instore.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;supply-chain&quot;&gt;4 SUPPLY CHAIN&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt; Continuity of supply is absolutely crucial. So you need to know that you can replenish stock fast.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;technology&quot;&gt;5 TECHNOLOGY&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt; You need a web platform. This is the technology that sits behind the front-end customer experience and drives the functionality of the website. You need something that will interface with, and talk to, your existing technology, which in turn will enable you to do things like click and collect, and manage stock, customer orders and content.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;site-design&quot;&gt;6 SITE DESIGN&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt; There is a saying that you may not want to get your creative site design from technology companies that build your platform. You will need someone to design the front end of the website and build out your ecommerce proposition.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;mobile&quot;&gt;7 MOBILE&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt; You also need to ensure that your site is fully optimised for mobile devices including smartphones and tablets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;hosting-and-domain-registration&quot;&gt;8 HOSTING AND DOMAIN REGISTRATION&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt; The website needs to be hosted somewhere. Your web development provider will be able to help with this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-name&quot;&gt;9 THE NAME&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt; Make sure you check the domain name availability for your website. There’s no point in coming up with a name that isn’t available. You can acquire this from a vast number of domain name registration companies online.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;content-&quot;&gt;10 CONTENT  &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You will need to produce content for your website. This is also known as visual and product merchandising.  Of course, you already have to produce visual merchandising and point of sale material for your stores.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;pictures&quot;&gt;11 PICTURES&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt; You will need product images, lifestyle images and brand related images.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;words&quot;&gt;12 WORDS&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt; You will need product descriptions as well as static, customer service related content, including terms and conditions and frequently asked questions. You will also need to think about how the content will influence your natural search engine ranking.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;seo-&quot;&gt;13 SEO  &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Customers can just walk into your physical store, but the same may not be true for your website. First of all you need to ensure that the website is search engine optimized (SEO). An agency can advise you on this, but in essence the site should be populated with content and meta data that enables the search engine to crawl and index your site.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;more-seo&quot;&gt;14 MORE SEO&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This will also include relevant keywords that related to what you sell, a good site map that can be successfully crawled by search engines, the meta tags that tell the search engine and web users what your site is about and alt tags for images that provide a brief description of the image.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;marketing&quot;&gt;15 MARKETING&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt; You can promote your website in the windows of your store as well as on all packaging. You will also need to promote it online through search engine marketing (SEM). This is where you pay or bid to acquire traffic when someone keys in a relevant keyword for your business such as black dress, cheap flights, gifts, washing machines etc.
The other marketing opportunities include retargeting. This is where the user has been on your site, goes elsewhere but sees an advert for your business.  The other key channel is affiliates. This is where other publishers send traffic to your website and get a commission on any sales made.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;customer-retention&quot;&gt;16 CUSTOMER RETENTION&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt; It’s cheaper to retain customers than acquire new ones. You should think about how you can build a lasting relationship with your customers so that you enjoy multiple purchases from them over the course of the year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;order-fulfillment&quot;&gt;17 ORDER FULFILLMENT&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt; To begin with, you’re likely to fulfill from store stock. But as your web business scales, you may need to think about having stock in a warehouse. You can do this with a third party logistics company.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;customer-service&quot;&gt;18 CUSTOMER SERVICE&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt; Some web customers will want to call you before and after making a purchase. So you need to be prepared for the potential of getting a lot more calls into your business that will take time to deal with. You can outsource this to a call centre, but this is not a profitable route to go down in the early stages.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;customer-first&quot;&gt;19 CUSTOMER FIRST&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt; The most important thing to think about is the customer. What can you do to optimise everything you do to meet customer needs?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;resourcing-it&quot;&gt;20 RESOURCING IT&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt; You’ll most likely require a different skill set from what you have currently in the business. Therefore, you might want to consider outsourcing elements where you lack the appropriate skills in your business such as acquisition and retention marketing.&lt;/p&gt;

Retail journalist John Ryan picks his seven fundamental factors if you’re to stand a fighting chance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Opening a shop is easy. You know your customers, you know what they want and you’re the person to bring the two parts of this equation together. All of this is probably the case for the great majority of wannabe independent retailers, so why do things go awry?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are any number of reasons, but here are seven to remember.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;location-are-the-right-shoppers-in-the-area&quot;&gt;1 LOCATION… are the ‘right’ shoppers in the area?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From the outset the single most important element is location.  It’s common sense but surprising how frequently independent retailers overlook the basics. When looking at where to rent a unit don’t make assumptions about the local demographic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Putting cans of car engine oil on the shelves of a store in an area with very low per capita car ownership is unlikely to reap ready rewards. Equally, when it comes to fashion, towns and districts that have a more mature population are not going to favour teenwear, for example.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;location-can-you-achieve-standout-or-will-you-be-one-of-many&quot;&gt;2 LOCATION… can you achieve standout, or will you be one of many?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And don’t forget to check out the local competition. If there are three other shops like the one you are proposing, think again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Research about an area can be as simple as having a coffee at different times of day in a local café a couple of times a week for several weeks. Do this and the chances are good that you’ll understand the shoppers in an area and whether they’ll want what you intend to offer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;location-cost-v-footfall&quot;&gt;3 LOCATION… cost v footfall&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is also the tension between rental cost and footfall. It’s an inconvenient truth that shops with the highest number of people passing in front of them will be the most costly from which to operate. Yet sometimes, and particularly if a retailer operates at the lower end of the price scale, it may be worth paying more in order to enjoy the shopper volume that will be required for the business to flourish.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;shop-size-can-you-afford-to-have-a-meaningful-offer-in-your-chosen-unit&quot;&gt;4 SHOP SIZE… can you afford to have a meaningful offer in your chosen unit?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another element is the size of unit. A large shop needs a certain minimum stock level if it is not to feel like a ballroom. Space in a store generally carries connotations of luxury, but too much space and it can feel as if a shop is under-stocked.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;fit-out-a-good-idea-will-always-trump-expensive-shop-equipment&quot;&gt;5 FIT-OUT… a good idea will always trump expensive shop equipment.&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once all the location boxes are ticked and stock can be afforded, what else is vital? The answer is ‘fit-out’. Just buying a few fixtures and some second-hand mannequins may seem like the right thing, but unless all of the parts equate to a themed whole, then this is a dog that won’t bark.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sometimes rough and ready, when set against carefully crafted stock can make for an interesting juxtaposition. There’s more to store design and layout than just ensuring everything has a place – shoppers need to feel a sense of difference and that they are welcome – and don’t forget that lighting can be the difference between very good and less so.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Think of an in-store theme and run with it…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;name-your-shop-this-is-your-brand&quot;&gt;6 NAME YOUR SHOP… this is your brand.&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, time spent thinking about what your new venture might be called is essential. The name above a shop door is part of your brand and if this isn’t instantly recognisable, retail oblivion may await.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;shorter-attention-spans&quot;&gt;1 Shorter attention spans&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The customer’s attention span is now shorter, there used to be a 13-week product cycle, now she’s bored after four.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;agile-supplier-relations&quot;&gt;2 Agile supplier relations&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You need to trade together weekly with suppliers to be agile.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;multiple-sourcing-strategy&quot;&gt;3 Multiple sourcing strategy&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You have to buy for the channel, if you sell through wholesale and direct you need a dual sourcing strategy to manage big volume orders and in season drops.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;seasonless&quot;&gt;4 Seasonless&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There aren’t really seasons anymore – just a financial half year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;black-friday&quot;&gt;5 Black Friday&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Black Friday changed the world, it has changed the shape of Christmas and you’ve got to do it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Being at a trade show can be a bit like a deer caught in headlights; it’s vital to prepare, social networks and high end style blogs can be a great source of new product ideas.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;filter&quot;&gt;2 Filter&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finding new suppliers is not a big issue, it’s filtering them that’s important, ensuring you get unique and differentiated product.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;walk&quot;&gt;3 Walk&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You’ve got to be able to ‘sniff out’ the right suppliers at a trade fair, you’ve got to work hard and walk all the aisles, see how busy they are, how they approach you.&lt;/p&gt;

Retail marketing expert Stella Hartley sets out the key rules.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The customer has always been King (or Queen) to retailers, now with the growth of e-commerce and digital media it seems we are sometimes overwhelmed with customer data, not only what customers have bought or spent but what they are thinking and feeling and how they are living their lives.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The vital thing for retailers is to focus on what all this data actually means for them and to think about WHY customers behave in the way they do and how retailers can influence this behaviour.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s about getting to what marketers call ‘insights’, key information about your customers that you can use to shape your offer and gain competitive advantage whatever channels you sell through.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;talking-helps&quot;&gt;1 TALKING HELPS&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There’s no substitute to actually talking to customers, preferably physically when they are shopping, in focus groups or virtually through Social Media, product reviews or SurveyMonkey. Conversations and listening can help you make sense of and provide rationales for the sales data you are analysing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;speed&quot;&gt;2 SPEED&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A key trend most retailers have spotted is that customers are more demanding, the internet has sped everything up, customers want more newness, they have a shorter attention span, one seasonal range isn’t going to excite them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;added-value&quot;&gt;3 ADDED VALUE&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They can price compare instantly online so it’s better to have exclusive product or an added value shopping experience and a strong brand reputation that customers trust. If they buy online they want deliveries faster and to be able to return products quickly and easily (and preferably at no cost!)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;segmentation&quot;&gt;4 SEGMENTATION&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Customer segmentation can be a really useful tool to help you understand customer types, who is buying what, which segment is commercially more valuable, which segment is growing. Make sure your range reflects the segments but importantly not too many segments or the offer will look too fragmented and your brand will lack focus. Sometimes deciding who your customer isn’t is as important as deciding who it is.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;discounting&quot;&gt;5 DISCOUNTING&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Customers are increasingly savvy about promotions and special offers, the recession has taught them to wait for the discounts which now are more frequent and less likely to be twice yearly big sales.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;events&quot;&gt;6 EVENTS&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Instead, Black Friday has become the most anticipated retail event of the year which has made both customers and retailers rethink the crucial lead up to Christmas. Customers now feel that if they don’t shop that weekend or don’t get some amazing buys they have somehow failed! Even small businesses can create relevant offers that add value rather than succumb to big discounts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;have-a-point-of-view&quot;&gt;7 HAVE A POINT OF VIEW&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Having a clear point of view is crucial to creating a strong brand and building a relationship with customers. Importantly, it also gives you a framework within which to develop your range. Some retailers can rely on suppliers to do all the work and come up with a constant stream of new ideas, but it depends on the sector you are in and the quality of your supply base.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;tread-carefully-with-trends&quot;&gt;8 TREAD CAREFULLY WITH TRENDS&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Advice from seasoned designers and buyers is don’t slavishly follow trends, use the good forecasting tools that are available but look everywhere (markets, vintage, blogs, cool brands) for ideas and inspiration. Sometimes originality is in the ability to edit. WGSN, Style.com, Premier Vision, Pitti Filati, Pitti Uomo, Maison et Objets and Heimtextil can all provide good research opportunities but everyone follows everyone else – how to break out and be different is a real skill, particularly when you want to have a POV but not get caught with stock you can’t shift!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;be-culturally-aware&quot;&gt;9 BE CULTURALLY AWARE&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you are a major department store business you can more easily monitor macro economic and lifestyle trends with hired experts, if not you have to be aware of what’s going on around you. Be aware that the popularity of the Great British Bake Off and the growing interest in gardening and knitting means that alongside technology there is a consumer trend which is about more authentic, homespun, tactile activities and relaxation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;filter-the-information&quot;&gt;10 FILTER THE INFORMATION&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a world that’s shrinking with global communications and transport networks it’s not difficult to find lots of potential suppliers to help with product development, but it’s the filtering of those suppliers, whether on ethical grounds, style, fashionability, price, quality, reliability and crucially fit with your brand and POV, that is the challenge.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;remember-to-look-up&quot;&gt;11 REMEMBER TO LOOK UP&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s about being aware of what’s happening outside your business, it’s all too easy to be very inwardly focused particularly when running a small business with little resource.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="in-store" /><summary>If changing consumer behaviour is driving the move away from traditional seasons, it is even more important to be able to understand data and trends.

There is less certainty in how customers will feel and spend in 12 or even 6 months’ time so there is little logic in committing vital budget that far ahead.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How can retailers best serve their customers and plan well for key seasonal promotions and events in the new consumer landscape? Inside Retail surveyed a range of independent, multiples and pure-play retailers in the home and gift sectors to find out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is what they told us.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-changing-consumer&quot;&gt;THE CHANGING CONSUMER&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Retailing has always been about change and attracting customers with new products and looks. But today’s retail world is changing in a way we have never seen before.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Customers are behaving differently and believe they are empowered to shop wherever and whenever they want. They are no longer being dictated to by retailers curating collections put together by their buyers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A staggering 49% of retailers said that is now difficult or very difficult to predict how their customers will spend over the next 12 months.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a result, the traditional buying seasons make less commercial sense when the real requirement is for retailers to be able to respond faster and closer to the season. Retail buyers are more and more inclined to buy stock frequently and reactively throughout the year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unsurprisingly, Christmas is the most important trading period for 65% of respondents but even this most important and predictable season is being changed with the rise of pre-Christmas sales and discounting and Black Friday. For online-only retailers, a large group within the survey, Christmas is shown to be even more important for them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Easter, Valentine’s Day, Halloween and the school holidays are all cited strongly as promotional opportunities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is also important for retailers to capitalise on popular, one-off events. The Centre for Retail Research showed for example that the birth of the new Royal baby, Princess Charlotte, generated more than £80 million in retail sales with £27 million of that total being driven by souvenirs. It demanded a very fast response from suppliers and then retailers to meet this opportunity and special occasion which consumers wanted to commemorate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;meeting-changing-demand&quot;&gt;MEETING CHANGING DEMAND&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So how are retailers responding to these changing consumer spending patterns? The difficulty in predicting how consumers are going to react makes for difficult buying decisions and planning.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;31% of respondents say that with customers now always looking for new products they are having to change their buying pattern and bring it closer to season.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When this is translated into actual retail buying, the survey underlines the extent to which retailers are becoming more flexible. It shows for example that 15% of those responding will now leave up to 60% of their budgets to buy closer to the season. 21% – the biggest percentage of respondents – say that they will allocate 30% of their budgets closer to season. 
Compared with three years ago, 27% of retailers said that they had reduced their forward ordering. The reasons, apart from having to find new products to appeal to customers, reinforce the changing consumer picture by citing the fact that it is now important to manage budgets, the fact that there is better availability of stock closer to season and to be able to forecast better.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The improved availability of stock would seem to be a crucial factor in helping retailers manage their buying closer to season. A staggering 70% of respondents said that suppliers have made it easier to stagger buying patterns across the year.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="in-store" /><summary>Traditional buying seasons and patterns are under increasing pressure as consumer demand and expectations change.
