&lt;p&gt;It is important to let customers choose how they shop with you, which is why it’s key to have a website alongside your first store as a channel for customers to engage with you. It also represents an opportunity for you to extend your reach to more customers over a broader geographical area than you can do with your local store business.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;whats-the-customer-value-proposition&quot;&gt;What’s the customer value proposition?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You might also think of this in terms of what’s your USP? What will make your retail business stand out and why will customers want to buy from you? What’s the value to them in doing so? And how will you price in relation to your competitors?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You also have to think about what the customer convenience proposition will be.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From an online perspective, you need a clear convenience proposition. What delivery and returns options will you offer? Will you charge for these or offer them free? Much will depend upon what you sell, what your average order values are and what your competitors do.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;will-you-offer-click-and-collect&quot;&gt;Will you offer click and collect?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are advantages to doing so if you already have your first store You’ll convert more customers, and you’ll be able to sell them more products when they come into your store to pick up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;product-range&quot;&gt;Product range&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You’re only as good as the product you sell. Are there any gaps in your local retail environment that you could fill with an independent retail store?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The web also provides the opportunity to offer a slightly different product range. Unlike in your store, you’re not limited by physical space therefore you can potentially offer a broader range of products online.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;supply-chain&quot;&gt;Supply chain&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Continuity of supply is absolutely crucial. So whatever, you sell, you need to know that you can replenish stock in a timely fashion, otherwise you risk disappointing customers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;technology&quot;&gt;Technology&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you’re going online, you need a web platform. This is the technology that sits behind the front-end customer experience and drives the functionality of the website.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s the same as when thinking about the technology needs of the store: an electronic point of sale (EPOS), and how all the systems you use will talk to each other, as they will need to do so if you want to offer click and collect. There are potentially other systems you might need including systems to manage finance, stock, product information and content.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;site-design&quot;&gt;Site design&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is a saying that you shouldn’t get your creative (Site design) from technology companies (those who build your platform). You will need someone to design the front end of the website and build out your ecommerce proposition.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You also need to ensure that your site is fully optimized for mobile devices (That includes smartphones and tablets) as that is where you will reach most of your customers moving forward.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;hosting-and-domain-name&quot;&gt;Hosting and domain name&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The website needs to be hosted somewhere. Your web development provider, sometimes known as a web development agency or system integrator, will be able to help with this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When you’re coming up with a name for your retail business, make sure you check the domain name availability for your website at the same time. There’s no point in coming up with a name for your store that isn’t also available for your brand online. You can acquire this from a vast number of domain name registration companies online.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;content-and-vm&quot;&gt;Content and VM&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You will need to produce content for your website. This is also known as visual and product merchandising. Of course, you’ll also have to produce visual merchandising, also known as point of sale material for the store.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;customer-acquisition&quot;&gt;Customer acquisition&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Customers can just walk into your physical store, but the same may not be true for your website. First of all you need to ensure that the website is search engine optimized (SEO). You will need your agency to advice you on this, but in essence the site should be populated with content and meta data that enables the search engine to crawl and index your site.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This will also include relevant keywords that relate to what you sell, a good site map that can be successfully crawled by search engines, the meta tags that tell the search engine and web users what your site is about and alt tags for images that provide a brief description of the image.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="ecommerce" /><summary>Before building your first website, retail expert Martin Newman of Practicology outlines the key things you need to consider to ensure you win your share of business.</summary></entry><entry><title>Give Your Social Media Marketing a Boost</title><link href="http://inside-retail.garethjohnsdesign.com/articles/give-your-social-media-marketing-a-boost/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Give Your Social Media Marketing a Boost" /><published>2016-07-12T17:25:00+00:00</published><updated>2016-07-12T17:25:00+00:00</updated><id>http://inside-retail.garethjohnsdesign.com/articles/give-your-social-media-marketing-a-boost</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://inside-retail.garethjohnsdesign.com/articles/give-your-social-media-marketing-a-boost/">&lt;p&gt;Time and budget constraints are a constant challenge for indies when it comes to marketing.

Here, Insider Retail speaks to founder Simon Middleton about this unusual journey. We began by asking him to describe the brand:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Middleton:&lt;/strong&gt; We make menswear based on and inspired by imagery and the story of Ernest Shackleton, the Antarctic explorer. He’s our inspiration and his granddaughter is part owner of the business.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In clothing we started with knitwear that replicates the types of sweaters worn by Shackleton, before moving into outerwear, boots, and accessories – everything from socks to hats to gloves.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We sell direct-to-consumers through &lt;a href=&quot;www.shackletoncompany.com&quot;&gt;Shackletoncompany.com&lt;/a&gt; and are also building a trade stockist base in some really interesting places, such as the Natural History Museum, in &lt;a href=&quot;www.thebikeshed.cc/cafebarshopclub/&quot;&gt;The Bike Shed Motorcycle Club&lt;/a&gt; and some more conventional boutiques. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;youre-not-from-a-fashion-background-so-how-did-you-come-up-with-the-idea-of-creating-a-menswear-brand&quot;&gt;You’re not from a fashion background, so how did you come up with the idea of creating a menswear brand?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My background is advertising, marketing and branding for about 20 years. I’d planned to start my own branded business for some time and the first one I started was oriented toward musical instruments. About two years ago I opened the first banjo factory in Britain for about 60 years and called it Shackleton because the banjo had a significant role in his adventures.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;People kept asking us what else we had inspired by the Shackleton story and aesthetic. And suddenly I found myself running a fashion brand. That’s the part that’s really grown and taken off into a much wider audience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;how-did-you-finance-the-business&quot;&gt;How did you finance the business?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Going back more than three years ago, we started with a small investor who backed us before our ideas had really formed. That was enough to give us some money in the bank and some confidence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then in autumn 2013 I launched a Kickstarter campaign for the banjo factory and we raised £50,000 in advance orders which gave us money in the bank, confidence and market testing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It also brought us to the attention of people who loved the story of Shackleton, and that we were making in Britain, as well as to the attention of angel investors who were looking for small companies in which to invest in. We raised additional money that way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A year later we did another Kickstarter campaign for the clothing brand itself, raising another £35,000 in advance orders and yet more equity funding that way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m a late starter to the fashion business and at my age I had to move very fast, so we raised money fast and sold equity in the business fast. For us it’s paid off and given us traction.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;is-that-a-finance-strategy-youd-recommend&quot;&gt;Is that a finance strategy you’d recommend?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s worked well for us but if I was younger I might do it differently. I set the goal to make an international luxury brand. It’s a big thing to do in your mid-50s and the only way was to raise a lot of money fast, you need to sell a lot of sweaters to achieve that. We knew we needed external funding so we combined equity with crowdfunding.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a brand-manufacturer we needed the money for development and minimum production runs. We could have made some sweaters because knitwear is relatively inexpensive, but when you get into footwear and outerwear the minimum order quantities are substantial and you need resources.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;who-is-your-consumer&quot;&gt;Who is your consumer?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s changing. We started off making folk musical instruments so the majority of our customers were middle-aged blokes aged over 45. They were also the first consumers of our knitwear, but the age is dropping as we move into boutiques which target trendy, affluent young professional men, and places like The Bike Shed Motorcycle Club. We’ve followed our demographic rather than controlled it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;how-has-this-changed-your-product&quot;&gt;How has this changed your product?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On our next iteration of knitwear and outwear our badging will be subtler. We’ve essentially moved into luxury fashion where the branding needs to be more discrete and the product itself does the talking. The feedback has come from stockists but also our new customers through individual reviews on our retailer’s websites.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;how-did-you-decide-that-was-the-right-price-bracket-for-you&quot;&gt;How did you decide that was the right price bracket for you?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’re in the premium-meets-luxury territory and made in Britain. Once you make that commitment, you have to understand there will be a price impact especially as we became more ambitious about what we wanted to make, such as outerwear which is more complex than knitwear. The only way you can succeed is by going higher up the market.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;will-your-supply-chain-continue-to-be-in-britain-only-as-you-expand-the-business&quot;&gt;Will your supply chain continue to be in Britain only as you expand the business?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the moment everything is made here but there may come a time in the next couple of seasons where we have to produce outside the UK as an addition.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Making everything in Britain is part of our story and we have a very short chain. In knitwear I can tell you which company produced the certified yarn and they will know which wool grower it came from, so it’s farmer to the consumer in just five or six steps.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Making in Britain has challenges as well as virtues. I can speak directly and easily to the people making our product, and minimums are lower. I can produce 50 sweaters, or even fewer. Turnaround is faster, samples can come in the post the next day. Design meetings are much easier in the Midlands and in Scotland.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That’s an enormous advantage, but it comes at a cost. People get paid higher wages. There’s a much higher actual cost per unit but there are other advantages. For the moment it works well for us.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;what-are-your-future-plans-for-the-business&quot;&gt;What are your future plans for the business?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Over the next 12 months we want to double our range of outerwear and knitwear and retailers. We’ll also expand the range and take more stories about Shackleton and similar people to develop that. In five years my ambition is to have built an internationally recognised luxury menswear brand. That’s a big ambition.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="ecommerce" /><summary>Menswear brand Shackleton began life as a banjo manufacturer before almost accidentally moving into fashion.

&lt;p&gt;But it hasn’t always been an easy journey. Founder Mark Neale shares the lessons he’s learned on the road to success.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;know-your-ambitions&quot;&gt;Know your ambitions&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mountain Warehouse started in 1997 as a discount, clearance shop for branded outdoor clothing located in McArthur Glen’s Swindon outlet centre. A second store followed within the Cheshire Oaks outlet centre and we now have more than 240 stores.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was always thinking of a national chain of shops rather than just one or two shops. You have to have a clear idea of that early but also be very open-minded about allowing the business to evolve and finding a formula that works.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;experiment&quot;&gt;Experiment&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You have to keep trying things and be open-minded. If something isn’t working, find out how to do it better or change it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By 2002 the business had grown to about 30 shops but was struggling, and I was forced to review everything.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the areas of the business that was successful at that time was our own brand. So the big idea was to move completely to own brand. It might not have worked but thankfully it did and we’ve never looked back since and have opened between 20 and 30 shops a year ever since.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;know-your-customers&quot;&gt;Know your customers&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It seems obvious but too many small retailers set up the business they would want to buy from. I would never say I’m a hill walker or a mountain climber, but all our buyers have a clear idea about our customers who do want to take part in those pursuits.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;manage-your-risk&quot;&gt;Manage your risk&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can’t be afraid of risk. Many people don’t purse their dream of opening a shop because they’re waiting for the perfect idea but it often never comes along. They are also worried it might fail and put everything at risk including the family home. But it’s vital to manage your risk – you don’t have to risk everything and nor should you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;seize-opportunities&quot;&gt;Seize opportunities&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is also important to recognize and react to any opportunities that present themselves to you. By 2007, the retail property market hit a big downturn and I suddenly found that landlords were very happy to talk to me about taking shops and on very favourable terms. In 2010 we’d opened our 100th shop and we continue to open on the same scale.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;location&quot;&gt;Location&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s absolutely critical. We might still be opening up to 30 shops a year but I will spend time standing in a high street watching shoppers and where they buy from before deciding that it is the right place to open a shop.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="in-store" /><summary>Privately-owned specialist outdoor retailer Mountain Warehouse continues to post record-breaking annual sales and pre-tax profits, recently notching up four consecutive years of growth including online sales up 49%.</summary></entry><entry><title>Brothers We Stand</title><link href="http://inside-retail.garethjohnsdesign.com/articles/brothers-we-stand/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Brothers We Stand" /><published>2016-07-12T17:21:00+00:00</published><updated>2016-07-12T17:21:00+00:00</updated><id>http://inside-retail.garethjohnsdesign.com/articles/brothers-we-stand</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://inside-retail.garethjohnsdesign.com/articles/brothers-we-stand/">&lt;p&gt;Brothers We Stand is an online menswear retailer that sells a curated range of ethical designer collections. Here, Inside Retail hears founder Jonathan Mitchell’s startup story. We began by asking him to describe the business in his own words:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mitchell:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.brotherswestand.com&quot;&gt;Brothers We Stand&lt;/a&gt; is a platform for different designers designing sustainably and ethically. We search out amazing designers who are really innovating in how they make their product and bring them together into one special collection and sell directly to consumers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;you-havent-come-in-via-the-fashion-school-route-so-how-come-youre-the-founder-of-a-fashion-business-test&quot;&gt;You haven’t come in via the fashion school route, so how come you’re the founder of a fashion business? Test&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It just sort of happened, I’ve always been interested in business so when I graduated from university with a degree in international development, I noticed there were a growing number of sustainable designers producing really nice stuff. I thought it would be cool to bring them together, so I chatted it through with friends and spent about a year planning. I got a loan of £3,100 from The Prince’s Trust to start it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is hard work because you have to do everything, but it’s achievable and you don’t necessarily need to have a huge amount of money.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;how-did-you-manage-the-financial-perspective-during-the-early-days-of-the-business&quot;&gt;How did you manage the financial perspective during the early days of the business?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think we were quite smart in having a business model that didn’t require much investment - we don’t produce anything and our product comes direct from designers.  Our biggest expense was the website, but even now I wouldn’t spend as much on it. You can use templates to set one up for free, and design it well enough to get your initial sales.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because I’m new to this I would have burned a lot of money and wasted it at the beginning as we going through that learning curve. It was invaluable to go slowly. I was fortunate to have friends to help out but also found that if you can hustle and do things without spending too much money, it’s a good way to learn how things work and test things.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;how-did-you-decide-who-your-customer-is&quot;&gt;How did you decide who your customer is?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s been a process of working it out and evolving over time. We stock quite a varied range of brands and we therefore have a broad range of customers. But what they have in common is that they want really nice products made in a production process that is conscious about the impact on people and the environment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;given-most-people-would-expect-ethical-to-mean-more-expensive-how-have-you-and-your-suppliers-set-about-achieving-such-reasonable-price-brackets&quot;&gt;Given most people would expect ethical to mean more expensive, how have you and your suppliers set about achieving such reasonable price brackets?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s hard to find brands that meet our high standards and that innovate for the future in a sustainable way. But all the brands we worked with have spent a lot of time working with their supply chain with a real clear focus on the price they want the garment to be and the community they want to reach. All of their stories are different: some use end-of-line materials, which are cheaper to get hold of; or a great factory in India and they’re working together to make great products.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It takes time to find those good factories but it’s worth putting the time in so that you have a product with a great story that you’re proud of and that differentiate you from the bigger brands.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;what-are-your-next-steps&quot;&gt;What are your next steps?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To continue taking it forward step by step. I want the way our products are made to become more and more important to our society. I want to be part of that through what I’m doing with the business and grow the product range and increase our impact step by step.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;[Ethical] is niche at the moment, but that’s where all mainstream things start. I’d love to see sustainable production go mainstream.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="ecommerce" /><summary>Brothers We Stand is an online menswear retailer that sells a curated range of ethical designer collections.

If you’re ready to start exporting, Google’s country sales director Peter Fitzgerald highlights some of the tools available and things to consider.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;digital-first-for-flexibility&quot;&gt;Digital-first for flexibility&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even if you use a multi-channel retail strategy for your operations in the UK, consider a digital-first model for new markets. A light ecommerce presence instead of a more intensive physical one means retailers can change and internationalise more flexibly and more quickly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Consider, too, setting up an agile team within your business devoted to international exports. If it can operate quickly and autonomously as a separate entity, it can make appropriate decisions for new markets quickly and projects can evolve faster and more fluidly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;researching-your-new-markets&quot;&gt;Researching your new markets&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When researching your target markets have a look at available data to prioritise the countries where your products or services will appeal most. Some of the online tools available for exploring potential markets include the Google Global Market Finder. This uses worldwide internet search data to show country keyword searches, estimates for bids and competition for each keyword by market and language.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once you’ve identified markets, drill down to discover your target customers’ expectations and ways to exceed them. Make sure you understand how consumers use the internet in their path to purchase. Research data from free export tools will allow you to better understand different target markets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When it comes to customers abroad, don’t rely on hunches. Instead, employ data analytics tools and analyst research to localise your offer according to market suitability and performance. This will enable you to not only alter to your site, product, marketing and pricing appropriately, but also to keep your finger on the pulse of market changes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;localising-your-website&quot;&gt;Localising your website&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Localising your website for different languages and currencies was once seen as a hurdle, but a range of tools now makes this far easier. For example, the UK’s largest independent online beauty retailer Beautybay.com used Google’s free translator tool to translate its website into 80 languages for overseas consumers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;use-marketplaces-to-test-and-learn&quot;&gt;Use marketplaces to test and learn&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you’re not quite ready to set up your own website, marketplaces such as Amazon, eBay or Alibaba can provide a cost-effective first step into a market, providing the opportunity to test and learn with limited investment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many businesses are reaping the benefits of using services such as these which provide access to localised marketing, supply chain and payment options that can boost the uptake of your products. And because they hold information about consumer demand and supply, marketplaces can furnish valuable advice on gaps in the market.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If or when you later develop a website, your marketplace presence will have established valuable exposure among an extensive customer base.&lt;/p&gt;

Retail investor relations expert Paul Barker explains why you should consider it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even if your company isn’t publicly quoted or doesn’t have institutional or retail shareholders there are potential gains for independent retailers in sharing your corporate story. Nowhere more so than differentiating in a highly competitive market, and raising finance for the purpose of accelerating business growth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is less of a need today to sell equity in your business as non-traditional sources of debt finance emerge, bolstered by the emergence of crowdsourcing, credit funds and mini-bonds.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In these cases, independent retailers need to tell their corporate stories in a more compelling and transparent way and to a wider audience than they might have done in the past.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Both mini-bonds and crowdfunding, for example, are typically offered to private investors who are also existing customers. This, in turn, increases interest and awareness in the success of the brand. In effect, the lines that used to be drawn between corporate and customer communication aren’t just becoming blurred; they’re ceasing to exist.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This doesn’t mean independent retailers have to start quarterly corporate reporting, but regular content and media engagement which is both relevant and appropriate for the size and profile of the business can be useful.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Developing a richer corporate narrative also brings the potential to unlock ‘softer’ business benefits, including promoting the business as a great place to work and attracting the best new talent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here are five easy-wins that will help you on the road to effective corporate communications:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Develop the About Us section of your company’s website. Management profiles, company vision and strategy, case studies and, where possible, bring your ‘investment case’ to life by using visuals and video.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Speak to your PR agency, if you have one, to ask for specialist corporate advice to help plan a programme of corporate engagement.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Debate with your board and senior management what metrics and level of financial information you are prepared to disclose to and how frequently – headline performance combined with a succinct narrative about strategic and operational highlights during the period under review are your starting point.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Consider an online annual report (hard copies are often an unnecessary expense for independent businesses) which reflects your brand and headline financial performance and will be of interest to employees, suppliers, landlords, funders, customers and other stakeholders.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The media is increasingly interested in trends and commentary on the wider market, rather than just individual financial performance, so before you engage develop some interesting narratives about your business and the markets in which it operates.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;

Retail property expert Tom Stanbury, Director of Central London Retail for CBRE answers some key questions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-first-store-has-worked-what-are-the-triggers-to-establish-a-second-or-more&quot;&gt;The first store has worked, what are the triggers to establish a second or more?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is rare that an independent retailer would open a second store without the first store already making a profit. Independent retailers are rightly cautious because it is their money they are investing. Is a retailer seeing consistent growth in sales, do they have good accounts which show profit, do they have the supply lines to expand?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;what-tips-can-you-share-on-how-an-indie-can-best-time-branching-out&quot;&gt;What tips can you share on how an indie can best time branching out?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Investigate where there are more flexible lease terms available, so that you are not tied in to an unsustainable lease length and cost. It is also worth approaching landlords around the terms of the lease – are these based on the performance of the store to try and share the risk? Also instructing a property agent can be useful. They can advise on market conditions and speak to other retailers who have been there before and grown successfully.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;what-internal-changes-do-you-need-to-make-as-you-start-expanding&quot;&gt;What internal changes do you need to make as you start expanding?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You’ll need to try and keep your overheads to a minimum so look out for cost-saving opportunities. When fitting a space out, it’s possible to gain relief from business rates payments and much of your expenditure in relation to fitting a store out would be tax deductible if you ensure you apply for the right capital allowances. You’ll also need to recruit staff who have distinct and different roles. Indies are usually good generalists but as things expand you will benefit from specialists.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;how-do-you-choose-between-a-regional-or-national-strategy&quot;&gt;How do you choose between a regional or national strategy?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In my opinion it is easier logistically if you go for a regional strategy but arguably with on-line the next market could be another major city rather than the nearest town.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="in-store" /><summary>Expanding beyond your first store is one of the biggest decisions an independent will ever have to make.

Ilona Taillade, Chief Marketing Officer, &lt;a href=&quot;https://wearepopup.com&quot;&gt;We Are Pop Up&lt;/a&gt; explains why the humble pop-up could be a good first step.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What is pop-up and how does it differ from a stall in a market or a stand in a shopping centre?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We classify pop-up space as any short-term, empty retail space. This can be anything from an empty shop on a high street, to an entire building, a gallery, a warehouse, or a more quirky space such as a boat or a disused bus depot. It’s also possible to book ‘ShopShare’ space, which is concession space within an existing store.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;what-are-pop-ups-good-for&quot;&gt;What are pop-ups good for?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Think about a pop-up as an excellent way to test your business concept, build awareness of your brand and meet customers. We’ve worked with hundreds of designers who started out over a weekend or a few days and have grown to established, successful companies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The beauty of a pop-up is that you can test different locations easily – don’t be afraid to experiment, and try something unusual or unexpected.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;what-tips-do-you-have-about-choosing-a-space&quot;&gt;What tips do you have about choosing a space?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Choose somewhere that complements your unique brand and your style. When you’re picking a space, look at what’s going on in the surrounding area – what brands are you near to, is the passing foot traffic the right demographic for you, does the culture fit your brand?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you’re doing to a ShopShare, is there an exciting brand clash you can do that will draw attention to your story? Why not pop-up your floral prints in a florists or your menswear in a barber’s shop?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;how-do-you-make-a-pop-up-work&quot;&gt;How do you make a pop-up work?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;People pop-up for a number of reasons, so to make a pop-up work, really think about what success looks like you. Is it purely sales? Is it purely awareness of your brand? Is it educating customers about your product range? It could be any or all of these, but keep the aim in mind.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We like to encourage brands to use the ‘lean start-up methodology’ of measure, test, learn as you go along. We encourage our customers to not be afraid to experiment and take risks. Collaborate with like-minded brands to build your networks and tap into each-others’ customer base, and make use of all the incredible social media tools at your fingertips, to tell your current customers where you are, and to reach out to new ones.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;once-youve-tried-it-what-can-you-do-next&quot;&gt;Once you’ve tried it, what can you do next?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Again, this depends on what your original objectives were. Do you want to be a global brand? In which case why not plot a city-by-city pop-up tour? Or do you want to be an ecommerce business, in which case plan for a few pop-ups in key locations at key seasonal moments (for example at a design/fashion/ craft week or Christmas). Or perhaps you’d like to plot a series of collaborations.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="in-store" /><summary>For many brands starting out, a first foray into a physical space can be a daunting prospect.
