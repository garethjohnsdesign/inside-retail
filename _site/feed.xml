&lt;p&gt;Young Ideas is a womenswear boutique in Derbyshire.  By any measure it has been a success, scooping awards and expanding and thriving in business.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The remarkable thing is that owner Anne Wright acquired the store in 2008 – just before the recession struck.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;She says: “It forced us to look even harder at the business and understand it better.” &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While the store had been running since the late 60s, Wright says it had run out of steam and wasn’t winning any new, younger customers to replace the older ones before she bought it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Suddenly that went from crucial to urgent. How did Wright manage it? &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“The key lesson is that you have to completely immerse yourself in the business to be able to understand it,” she says.  
“This is absolutely essential for a fashion business such as this, which depends on forward ordering.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“I needed to be involved in everything for at least 18 months so that I could understand what customers wanted, how they were buying and who they were. It is absolutely essential to know your customers if you are going to survive as an independent retailer.” &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Wright didn’t only survive despite the economic upheaval. The disruption worked to Wright’s advantage too.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“The recession also brought with it opportunities. In 2011, we opened in Derby city centre, in a new store. It was a good location with a low overhead. and we were beginning to feel confident about the brand portfolio.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“This was definitely when I felt I was starting up a business because this was a new store for Young Ideas in a different town.”  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then when the landlord of the original store refused to negotiate the rent, Wright relocated to a bigger premises, moving Young Ideas to an iconic but empty seventeenth century coach house in Ashbourne.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Wright has since developed the premises to add new units and add a restaurant as well as adding menswear.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; The result? The business has tripled since 2008. Who says you can’t build success in difficult times?   &lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="inspiration" /><summary>If you think that the recent strains of political, economic and social upheaval are reason enough to put off that stellar business plan, think again.</summary></entry><entry><title>Ethical Fashion As Your USP</title><link href="http://inside-retail.garethjohnsdesign.com/articles/ethical-fashion-as-your-usp/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Ethical Fashion As Your USP" /><published>2016-07-21T16:07:00+00:00</published><updated>2016-07-21T16:07:00+00:00</updated><id>http://inside-retail.garethjohnsdesign.com/articles/ethical-fashion-as-your-usp</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://inside-retail.garethjohnsdesign.com/articles/ethical-fashion-as-your-usp/">&lt;p&gt;Valleryana Allemand is the CEO of Saxa, an etailer that provides a shopfront more than 60 ethical designers and sells globally.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;She spoke with i2i content editor Sophy Searight.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;what-is-saxa-about&quot;&gt;What is Saxa about?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s the world’s premier platform for young ethical designers. We focus on designers producing locally, so they boost the economy of their own country but are also making high quality products with amazing designs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;what-does-ethical-production-mean&quot;&gt;What does ethical production mean?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s about how it was made. Every piece is made locally by people who are fairly paid adults. Today there are 250m children working in the world. Eighty five per cent work in fashion and those children are only working because we make the demand.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;whats-been-the-highlight-this-year&quot;&gt;What’s been the highlight this year?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’ve been endorsed by many celebrities and even featured on Bar Rafaeli on the cover of GQ magazine in 40 countries. Through partnerships we’ve been able to take children out of labour and put them in school for one month.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;why-set-up-this-business-in-this-niche&quot;&gt;Why set up this business in this niche?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First of all because the issue exists and has always bothered me. People don’t really seem to care about it or they just pretend to not know.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But also as a customer, I used to go to trade shows and see such nice young designers doing amazing work but they were smashed by competition between fast fashion and big labels. That was unfair. I would like as a customer to be able to track them down. So I put them together in one website so everyone like me could find them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;how-did-you-know-if-it-was-a-commercial-possibility&quot;&gt;How did you know if it was a commercial possibility?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I never knew if it was possible or not. But when customers came from all over the world, that was the validation that the market was there, the need was there and people were really searching for it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;there-is-a-perception-that-ethical-fashion-is-expensive-how-do-you-price&quot;&gt;There is a perception that ethical fashion is expensive. How do you price?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The designers give us the retail price and we work with that.  It’s a ‘between’ product between fast fashion and high end. We use with the same quality of material and design as big labels, so it’s a very affordable price.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;but-is-there-an-additional-margin-for-ethical-production&quot;&gt;But is there an additional margin for ethical production?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No we just want to be sure that everyone in the process are fairly paid. We have a bag for one hundred euro. It would be two or three times-as-much if it had a big label on it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;how-do-you-ensure-your-ethical-values-are-in-place&quot;&gt;How do you ensure your ethical values are in place?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We ask the brands to send a lot of paperwork – including how the materials  are sourced. If there is any doubt we don’t go ahead. Most  young designers produce locally but we also have to make sure the fabric is not from any market that uses child labour or slavery.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;what-should-responsible-retailers-look-out-for-ethically&quot;&gt;What should responsible retailers look out for, ethically?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Price. If you see a dress for 60 euro, you can be sure it is not produced. And look at the quality – it says right away if something is not made with care.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;how-can-a-retailer-control-their-sourcing&quot;&gt;How can a retailer control their sourcing?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can never control it. If a big brand says it has manufacturing in India that is are certified, OK, that’s great. But they will also get third party services from other small ones – those small ones is where the problem is. That’s where children are working for six cents per hour, up to 20 hours a day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;looking-at-your-marketing-how-do-you-balance-ethics-and-aesthetics&quot;&gt;Looking at your marketing, how do you balance ethics and aesthetics?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s both together. People confuse ethical with eco friendly – we try to make that clear. This is not eco friendly it’s the other side – want to show every woman they can buy ethical and be no less beautiful and luxurious.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;what-advice-would-you-give-to-anyone-starting-a-business&quot;&gt;What advice would you give to anyone starting a business?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First look at your competition and see what you can do that is different but still in the same sector. Just copying what others are doing wont get you anywhere.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="inspiration" /><summary>Valleryana Allemand is the CEO of Saxa, an etailer that provides a shopfront more than 60 ethical designers and sells globally.</summary></entry><entry><title>Don’t Just Sell to Your Customers, Style Them</title><link href="http://inside-retail.garethjohnsdesign.com/articles/dont-just-sell-to-your-customers-style-them/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Don’t Just Sell to Your Customers, Style Them" /><published>2016-07-21T16:01:00+00:00</published><updated>2016-07-21T16:01:00+00:00</updated><id>http://inside-retail.garethjohnsdesign.com/articles/dont-just-sell-to-your-customers-style-them</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://inside-retail.garethjohnsdesign.com/articles/dont-just-sell-to-your-customers-style-them/">&lt;p&gt;If you style your customers instead of selling to them you will boost sales and loyalty. So says styling consultant Nicky Hambleton-Jones, best-known for her role on Channel 4 show 10 Years Younger.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hambleton-Jones runs NHJ Style, which helps more than 7,500 clients to fill their wardrobes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here, along with NHJ style and training director Isobel Kershaw, she gives us her top tips for using in-house styling to boost sales…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;dont-be-a-salesperson-be-a-stylist&quot;&gt;1 Don’t be a salesperson, be a stylist&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“A sales assistant might offer a selection of jeans. A stylist will say I’m going to show you how to wear those jeans, and will style a look so the customer can see the wearability and flexibility of the garment. That extra level of advice ensures the customer has an amazing experience instead of you just making a sale.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;focus-on-the-experience-not-the-sale&quot;&gt;2 Focus on the experience, not the sale&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Ensure the customer has a good experience. They will feel good throughout the day, they leave the session looking good and more importantly get knowledge and advice. Ironically, that way the stylist will make a huge amount of sales, but that isn’t the focus.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;prepare-for-your-customers&quot;&gt;3 Prepare for your customers&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“As stylists we will know a customer’s measurements, lifestyle, wardrobe needs and budget in advance. We will pick the brands and pieces to fit their body shape put things aside for them.  There’s no reason why small retailers can’t have this relationship too.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;its-never-about-just-one-piece&quot;&gt;4 It’s never about just one piece&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Styling is about complete looks so that when a customer is trying something on, it’s three pieces at a time.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;focus-on-the-customer&quot;&gt;5 Focus on the customer&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“You have to be ‘on it’. You can’t leave them standing there in their underwear, cold and waiting for you. You have to work fast but without making them feel rushed.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;prepare-a-rail&quot;&gt;6 Prepare a rail&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“It’s about a complete wardrobe every time. So get a rail ready with basics, trend pieces and key updaters for your customers – everything that pulls a look together or the customer wont know how to do it.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;get-to-know-their-lifestyle&quot;&gt;7 Get to know their lifestyle&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“It’s no good putting a mum in a suit for the dog walk.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;have-a-lovely-big-changing-room&quot;&gt;8 Have a lovely big changing room&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Often, the bigger the retailer, the smaller the changing room, so here is somewhere the smaller indie retailers have flexibility. Offer seating, give them space and refreshments, like water or a cup of tea.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;tidy-up-as-you-go&quot;&gt;9 Tidy up as you go&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Get the stock that’s not working out, so the customer isn’t confused.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;stay-open-late-if-you-need-to&quot;&gt;10 Stay open late if you need to&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“You know you are going to make the sale if you keep the shop open late especially for a customer.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;dont-be-bland-in-store&quot;&gt;11 Don’t be bland in store&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Too many stores are very bland. There’s just nothing exciting in the window, inside there’s a lack of colour or interest and nothing jumps out. Even if it’s not about pieces your customers would normally wear you have to be visually exciting. It’s all about being aspirational and engaging.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;dont-be-pushy&quot;&gt;12 Don’t be pushy&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“I’ve heard pushy shop assistants saying ‘that looks amazing you’ve got to buy it’ and the customer comes out and is busting out. You can get customers to buy things that don’t really work but they’ll never wear it and be less likely to come back.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;give-your-staff-confidence&quot;&gt;13 Give your staff confidence&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“If the staff are trained with some basic styling skills, they get more confidence to engage with the customer and say let me get you a size down or that shape’s not working. They’re still going to make a sale and the customer is going to come back for more.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;buy-with-complete-outfits-in-mind&quot;&gt;14 Buy with complete outfits in mind&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“That way you will make more sales, and remember to buy colour. People say their customers do not want to buy colour. Well, that’s because you’re not buying it properly. And it stands out more and people talk.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;create-energy-and-movement-in-store&quot;&gt;15 Create energy and movement in store&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“No-one will go into a shop when there’s no one in there. Encourage your staff to look a bit like they’re customers, maybe even trying things on. And put the music on. Just not too loud.”&lt;/p&gt;

Here, Insider Retail speaks to founder Simon Middleton about this unusual journey. We began by asking him to describe the brand: 
Middleton: We make menswear based on and inspired by imagery and the story of Ernest Shackleton, the Antarctic explorer. He’s our inspiration and his granddaughter is part owner of the business. 
In clothing we started with knitwear that replicates the types of sweaters worn by Shackleton, before moving into outerwear, boots, and accessories – everything from socks to hats to gloves. 
We sell direct-to-consumers through Shackletoncompany.com and are also building a trade stockist base in some really interesting places, such as the Natural History Museum, in The Bike Shed Motorcycle Club and some more conventional boutiques. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;youre-not-from-a-fashion-background-so-how-did-you-come-up-with-the-idea-of-creating-a-menswear-brand&quot;&gt;You’re not from a fashion background, so how did you come up with the idea of creating a menswear brand?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My background is advertising, marketing and branding for about 20 years. I’d planned to start my own branded business for some time and the first one I started was oriented toward musical instruments. About two years ago I opened the first banjo factory in Britain for about 60 years and called it Shackleton because the banjo had a significant role in his adventures. 
People kept asking us what else we had inspired by the Shackleton story and aesthetic. And suddenly I found myself running a fashion brand. That’s the part that’s really grown and taken off into a much wider audience.&lt;br /&gt;
How did you finance the business? 
Going back more than three years ago, we started with a small investor who backed us before our ideas had really formed. That was enough to give us some money in the bank and some confidence. 
Then in autumn 2013 I launched a Kickstarter campaign for the banjo factory and we raised £50,000 in advance orders which gave us money in the bank, confidence and market testing. 
It also brought us to the attention of people who loved the story of Shackleton, and that we were making in Britain, as well as to the attention of angel investors who were looking for small companies in which to invest in. We raised additional money that way. 
A year later we did another Kickstarter campaign for the clothing brand itself, raising another £35,000 in advance orders and yet more equity funding that way. 
I’m a late starter to the fashion business and at my age I had to move very fast, so we raised money fast and sold equity in the business fast. For us it’s paid off and given us traction.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;is-that-a-finance-strategy-youd-recommend&quot;&gt;Is that a finance strategy you’d recommend?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s worked well for us but if I was younger I might do it differently. I set the goal to make an international luxury brand. It’s a big thing to do in your mid-50s and the only way was to raise a lot of money fast, you need to sell a lot of sweaters to achieve that. We knew we needed external funding so we combined equity with crowdfunding. 
As a brand-manufacturer we needed the money for development and minimum production runs. We could have made some sweaters because knitwear is relatively inexpensive, but when you get into footwear and outerwear the minimum order quantities are substantial and you need resources.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;who-is-your-consumer&quot;&gt;Who is your consumer?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s changing. We started off making folk musical instruments so the majority of our customers were middle-aged blokes aged over 45. They were also the first consumers of our knitwear, but the age is dropping as we move into boutiques which target trendy, affluent young professional men, and places like The Bike Shed Motorcycle Club. We’ve followed our demographic rather than controlled it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;how-has-this-changed-your-product&quot;&gt;How has this changed your product?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On our next iteration of knitwear and outwear our badging will be subtler. We’ve essentially moved into luxury fashion where the branding needs to be more discrete and the product itself does the talking. The feedback has come from stockists but also our new customers through individual reviews on our retailer’s websites.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;how-did-you-decide-that-was-the-right-price-bracket-for-you&quot;&gt;How did you decide that was the right price bracket for you?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We’re in the premium-meets-luxury territory and made in Britain. Once you make that commitment, you have to understand there will be a price impact especially as we became more ambitious about what we wanted to make, such as outerwear which is more complex than knitwear. The only way you can succeed is by going higher up the market.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;will-your-supply-chain-continue-to-be-in-britain-only-as-you-expand-the-business&quot;&gt;Will your supply chain continue to be in Britain only as you expand the business?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the moment everything is made here but there may come a time in the next couple of seasons where we have to produce outside the UK as an addition. 
Making everything in Britain is part of our story and we have a very short chain. In knitwear I can tell you which company produced the certified yarn and they will know which wool grower it came from, so it’s farmer to the consumer in just five or six steps. 
Making in Britain has challenges as well as virtues. I can speak directly and easily to the people making our product, and minimums are lower. I can produce 50 sweaters, or even fewer. Turnaround is faster, samples can come in the post the next day. Design meetings are much easier in the Midlands and in Scotland. 
That’s an enormous advantage, but it comes at a cost. People get paid higher wages. There’s a much higher actual cost per unit but there are other advantages. For the moment it works well for us. 
### What are your future plans for the business?
Over the next 12 months we want to double our range of outerwear and knitwear and retailers. We’ll also expand the range and take more stories about Shackleton and similar people to develop that. In five years my ambition is to have built an internationally recognised luxury menswear brand. That’s a big ambition.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="ecommerce" /><summary>Menswear brand Shackleton began life as a banjo manufacturer before almost accidentally moving into fashion.

The secret? Diversifying.&lt;br /&gt;
 The company, which operates in four locations across Hampshire, West Sussex and Dorset, has deep roots, going back to 1882, but things really took off when it started to branch out into new ranges and services.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Haskins’ buying director Conna Powles says it all started in 1994 when the original centre moved to a ten-acre site. To start with, this meant it was able to add more plants and garden accessories. But there was also a 260-seat restaurant.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; This has since been doubled in size and there are now restaurants at each of the centres and play areas at three of them. Plant advice centres, free WiFi, baby changing facilities, coffee shops and ample parking all help to combine ease of use with lengthened dwell time. One of its online offers is even for a swanky afternoon tea. (£16 for two people, thanks for asking, and advance booking is essential.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; But where the diversification really kicked in was with product. Powles says: “Introducing contemporary clothing has been a big move for us. We used to only sell Tigi, which is for a more mature customer. We introduced Weird Fish, White Stuff, Crew, Joules, Radley and Fiorelli. Growth has been in double digits each year and we are now taking more than £1m.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Then there was artificial floristry. “We used to sell stems but we introduced potted floristry and foliage. Sales increased by 98% in the first year,” says Powles.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; What else? “Solar lighting is an example of focus. A dedicated area made it a destination and with competitive promotions, it has become a £500k department to rival any of the big sheds.” 
 Powles says the buying team has to stay proactive. As well as trade show and online research, they share information with fellow Garden Trade Association members.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; We prepare a strategy paper that prompts us to come up with ideas. We then complete our market research in head office to get feedback on features and benefits as well as perceived value of products. Sometimes I ask the buyers to do a SWOT analysis on each other’s departments which works well too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; “We work strategically to drive sales rather than react to what is available. Therefore we challenge ourselves about opportunities through a specific way of thinking 
 It’s not all science. Gut instinct, she says, mustn’t be underestimated. “I have never regretted following my instincts but I have regretted not following them and seeing someone else get there first.” &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key lessons:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

When he joined in 1980, turnover was £179,000. It’s now a nine-figure sum. The brand has opened nearly 100 UK stores and expanded into Europe, Asia and the US.    Here are his tips on growing a business.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;it-takes-time&quot;&gt;1 It takes time&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt; We’ve gone from £179,000 turnover to £110m. It’s taken 35 years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;  ### 2 You need a clear idea&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Ours was to sell lovely quality Jermyn Street shirts at great prices.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;  ### 3 The secret&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; For us, the whole story revolves around knowledge of the product.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;  ### 4 Cut out the middlemen&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; We’ve spent our life doing it. Club ties were 50% of our sales, but we ordered them through a company who then placed the order. That seemed a little bit ridiculous – the company in the middle made a lot of money – so we approached a mill. They said ‘you’re a retailer, we can’t deal with you’…  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;so-do-the-necessary&quot;&gt;5 So do the necessary&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt; … so we opened a tie company the next week and went back. ‘We can deal with you now’, said the mill. That simple step made a huge difference to our profitability.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;be-more-than-a-retailer&quot;&gt;6 Be more than a retailer&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt; The lesson is that we didn’t think of ourselves just as retailers but as the cost centres involved in retailing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-tough-times-can-help&quot;&gt;7 The tough times can help&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt; In 200, we found we had a problem. We didn’t see the importance of branding and marketing. At the time, another company did a much better job of that and was bought by the Louis Vuitton group. My four little shops at the time were looking decidedly dicey. We challenged ourselves to look at pricing and started to use price as way of marketing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;detail-detail-detail&quot;&gt;8 Detail detail detail&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt; The critical points were getting into manufacturing and understanding the detail of how you make something. It opened up a whole world of going to factories and understanding how long it takes to sew in a standard zip or put on a front placket.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;you-need-a-little-bit-of-luck&quot;&gt;9 You need a little bit of luck&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt; We opened the fifth store in May of 2000. We planned to take £100,000 in the first month. In the first two days we took £98,000 and in the following five weeks took another £645,000.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;  ### 10 But you make that luck yourself&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; We had an offer on our shirts and had people taking a taxi from the city to the shop itself was only 85sqm, so people were virtually queuing outside the door. That was the lightbulb moment. You need something to happen that is significant – it had only happened because we were worried about going out of business.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;diy&quot;&gt;11 DIY&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt; From 2001 to 2006 we opened something in the region of 35 stores.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; We didn’t go to estate agents and say find me these, because though estate agents are very good, when you are investing your money that store it is incredibly important to make that right decision.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;  ### 12 Position is everything&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Every brand thinks they can get people to walk round the corner but the difference between being on the main street and the side street is huge.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So what we did – and I don’t know how many cups of coffee I drank – was sit outside the venues of potential stores for a day or two and look at the people who were walking past.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; ### 13 Have a formula&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Because we did this prolifically we got a little card, the size of a credit card, that had the square footage, the rent, staff costs, the rates on it, so we could say ‘this will take half a million pounds, does it work?’ You could do it when you were having your coffee. By 2012 we had over a hundred stores – every single one built on a model.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; ### 14 Look for a bigger solution&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; We went out to China and developed the fabric there and the manufacturing in Vietnam. Again this had a huge effect on cost price and if anything the quality is better because the skills they have are better.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; ### 15 Be an optimist&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; I’m excited about what I see as opportunities to go to next stage and I believe that £200m sales is something we will achieve – but only if we focus on the details.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is important to let customers choose how they shop with you, which is why it’s key to have a website alongside your first store as a channel for customers to engage with you. It also represents an opportunity for you to extend your reach to more customers over a broader geographical area than you can do with your local store business.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;whats-the-customer-value-proposition&quot;&gt;What’s the customer value proposition?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You might also think of this in terms of what’s your USP? What will make your retail business stand out and why will customers want to buy from you? What’s the value to them in doing so? And how will you price in relation to your competitors?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You also have to think about what the customer convenience proposition will be.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From an online perspective, you need a clear convenience proposition. What delivery and returns options will you offer? Will you charge for these or offer them free? Much will depend upon what you sell, what your average order values are and what your competitors do.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;will-you-offer-click-and-collect&quot;&gt;Will you offer click and collect?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are advantages to doing so if you already have your first store You’ll convert more customers, and you’ll be able to sell them more products when they come into your store to pick up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;product-range&quot;&gt;Product range&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You’re only as good as the product you sell. Are there any gaps in your local retail environment that you could fill with an independent retail store?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The web also provides the opportunity to offer a slightly different product range. Unlike in your store, you’re not limited by physical space therefore you can potentially offer a broader range of products online.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;supply-chain&quot;&gt;Supply chain&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Continuity of supply is absolutely crucial. So whatever, you sell, you need to know that you can replenish stock in a timely fashion, otherwise you risk disappointing customers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;technology&quot;&gt;Technology&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you’re going online, you need a web platform. This is the technology that sits behind the front-end customer experience and drives the functionality of the website.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s the same as when thinking about the technology needs of the store: an electronic point of sale (EPOS), and how all the systems you use will talk to each other, as they will need to do so if you want to offer click and collect. There are potentially other systems you might need including systems to manage finance, stock, product information and content.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;site-design&quot;&gt;Site design&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is a saying that you shouldn’t get your creative (Site design) from technology companies (those who build your platform). You will need someone to design the front end of the website and build out your ecommerce proposition.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You also need to ensure that your site is fully optimized for mobile devices (That includes smartphones and tablets) as that is where you will reach most of your customers moving forward.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;hosting-and-domain-name&quot;&gt;Hosting and domain name&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The website needs to be hosted somewhere. Your web development provider, sometimes known as a web development agency or system integrator, will be able to help with this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When you’re coming up with a name for your retail business, make sure you check the domain name availability for your website at the same time. There’s no point in coming up with a name for your store that isn’t also available for your brand online. You can acquire this from a vast number of domain name registration companies online.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;content-and-vm&quot;&gt;Content and VM&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You will need to produce content for your website. This is also known as visual and product merchandising. Of course, you’ll also have to produce visual merchandising, also known as point of sale material for the store.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;customer-acquisition&quot;&gt;Customer acquisition&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Customers can just walk into your physical store, but the same may not be true for your website. First of all you need to ensure that the website is search engine optimized (SEO). You will need your agency to advice you on this, but in essence the site should be populated with content and meta data that enables the search engine to crawl and index your site.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This will also include relevant keywords that relate to what you sell, a good site map that can be successfully crawled by search engines, the meta tags that tell the search engine and web users what your site is about and alt tags for images that provide a brief description of the image.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="ecommerce" /><summary>Before building your first website, retail expert Martin Newman of Practicology outlines the key things you need to consider to ensure you win your share of business.</summary></entry><entry><title>Give Your Social Media Marketing A Boost</title><link href="http://inside-retail.garethjohnsdesign.com/articles/give-your-social-media-marketing-a-boost/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Give Your Social Media Marketing A Boost" /><published>2016-07-20T09:19:00+00:00</published><updated>2016-07-20T09:19:00+00:00</updated><id>http://inside-retail.garethjohnsdesign.com/articles/give-your-social-media-marketing-a-boost</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://inside-retail.garethjohnsdesign.com/articles/give-your-social-media-marketing-a-boost/">&lt;p&gt;Time and budget constraints are a constant challenge for indies when it comes to marketing.

&lt;p&gt;But it hasn’t always been an easy journey. Founder Mark Neale shares the lessons he’s learned on the road to success.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;know-your-ambitions&quot;&gt;Know your ambitions&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mountain Warehouse started in 1997 as a discount, clearance shop for branded outdoor clothing located in McArthur Glen’s Swindon outlet centre. A second store followed within the Cheshire Oaks outlet centre and we now have more than 240 stores.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was always thinking of a national chain of shops rather than just one or two shops. You have to have a clear idea of that early but also be very open-minded about allowing the business to evolve and finding a formula that works.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;experiment&quot;&gt;Experiment&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You have to keep trying things and be open-minded. If something isn’t working, find out how to do it better or change it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By 2002 the business had grown to about 30 shops but was struggling, and I was forced to review everything.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the areas of the business that was successful at that time was our own brand. So the big idea was to move completely to own brand. It might not have worked but thankfully it did and we’ve never looked back since and have opened between 20 and 30 shops a year ever since.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;know-your-customers&quot;&gt;Know your customers&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It seems obvious but too many small retailers set up the business they would want to buy from. I would never say I’m a hill walker or a mountain climber, but all our buyers have a clear idea about our customers who do want to take part in those pursuits.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;manage-your-risk&quot;&gt;Manage your risk&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can’t be afraid of risk. Many people don’t purse their dream of opening a shop because they’re waiting for the perfect idea but it often never comes along. They are also worried it might fail and put everything at risk including the family home. But it’s vital to manage your risk – you don’t have to risk everything and nor should you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;seize-opportunities&quot;&gt;Seize opportunities&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is also important to recognize and react to any opportunities that present themselves to you. By 2007, the retail property market hit a big downturn and I suddenly found that landlords were very happy to talk to me about taking shops and on very favourable terms. In 2010 we’d opened our 100th shop and we continue to open on the same scale.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;location&quot;&gt;Location&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s absolutely critical. We might still be opening up to 30 shops a year but I will spend time standing in a high street watching shoppers and where they buy from before deciding that it is the right place to open a shop.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="in-store" /><summary>Privately-owned specialist outdoor retailer Mountain Warehouse continues to post record-breaking annual sales and pre-tax profits, recently notching up four consecutive years of growth including online sales up 49%.</summary></entry></feed>
