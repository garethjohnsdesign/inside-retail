They compare your prices with competitors both on and offline, search globally for new and interesting products, and have more choice through faster, easier Internet access on mobile and other channels.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Set against this background, what can a retailer do?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the very largest, the key priority is to go “omnichannel” where their stores and online channels work seamlessly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But for the thousands of smaller, independent retailers, what should a strategy for success look like?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Across i2i’s retail events of Spring and Autumn Fairs, Pure London and Jewellery and Watch, we asked hundreds of retailers just that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Leaving aside the core retail building blocks of having the right product at the right price and in the right location, one thing has emerged: winning customers today demands new additions to the offer or the services.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In other words, adding products or ranges that form a natural adjunct to your core, or by offering into new services that attract customers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The reason why is simple: to differentiate from competitors and to surprise and even delight customers with products they didn’t know you stocked, but which feel like a logical extension of your offer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One retailer told us: “It is vital to refresh and renew your product range.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another added: “There is a continuous requirement for new, different, unique and constantly refreshed stock.”
Garden centres have been some of the best exponents of this for years through extending their product ranges beyond plants and into gifts, Christmas and other seasonal goods and then restaurants and coffee shops.  For clothing retailers the research shows that an increasing number of womenswear specialists have added menswear or are considering it. The reason is two-fold.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Firstly, menswear is a faster growing category than womenswear, and secondly, women remain one of the biggest purchasers of menswear, for their partners and family, so it makes a great additional spend.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a survey of clothing retailers conducted for Pure London, 69% already stocked some menswear but were looking to increase this or for those who didn’t carry menswear, they were giving it serious consideration.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Clothing retailers are also increasingly looking at adding ranges of accessories from shoes to handbags and costume jewellery.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile the jewellery retailers are extending their offer by adding a value range or, at the other end of the scale, an upmarket brand or collection.  As one retailer said: “You have to think about creating bespoke ranges or products for your customers who are looking for something different.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The new retail climate means that all retailers have to “adapt or die”, as one retailer brutally put it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many independents are showing how they are adapting their businesses to win customers.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="inspiration" /><summary>As every retailer knows, consumers of all ages are more demanding than ever.

Here’s why…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Within the retail mix the pure product-based retailer, whether independent or multiple, is in long term decline, while those providing services and leisure have increased.
“Unless they are out-and-out specialist destinations for specialist consumers, diversification offers retailers a way to attract new customers and spread risk across a wider range of products.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“We see this everywhere in the wide membership of bira. Fashion shops add accessories, footwear and luggage. Cookshops extend into giftware and food. Gift shops show a sparkling ability to develop new lines in furniture, handbags, greetings cards, and clothing.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“The challenge for the independent retailers, strapped more for time even than cash, is to hunt down those new product areas that will widen their appeal, so trade shows offer them an increasingly valuable way to discover future winners with the least expenditure of time.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“An even bigger challenge comes from the ever growing range of competitors for each consumer pound.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“While the numbers of shops have grown since the crash, gaining more than 6,000 independents net since 2009, they have been more than matched by larger numbers of new online retailers, which may now be trading in the UK, anywhere in Europe and further afield.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“It helps to have elements to the business that require the customer to be in a shop, to help justify having a shop. So we see cookshops that have cafes and delis, fashion shops that provide bespoke tailoring, even toolshops that sell skills training.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“But footfall can no longer be relied on solely to deliver a growing base of consumers, even if the canny retailer diversifies the offer. Shops have to be where the attention of the shopper is if they are to be noticed and if the attention of the shopper is on Facebook or Twitter, on Amazon or eBay, then that’s where they need to be. This is diversification again, diversification into multiple networks.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“To make the most of those opportunities independents need to choose where to concentrate their efforts, to be nimble and to be quick.”&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="inspiration" /><summary>Mike Weedon is the deputy CEO and communications director of the British Independent Retailers Association (bira), which represents thousands of UK indies.   He says the days of pure-product retailers are numbered.

Paula Watson is head of brands at Lux Fix, an online fashion retailer that collates over 250 under-the-radar collections. She explains how the relationship should work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;demand-great-quality-imagery&quot;&gt;Demand great quality imagery&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’re not going to reshoot product so we work with brands’ imagery. It creates the first impression, so we need great photography – clean, beautiful model shots.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;curate-them&quot;&gt;Curate them&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They can be fantastic brands but not all their products will work. Shorts shorts, no-sleeves or you can’t wear it with a bra? Forget it. We have to get the right products for our customers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;its-a-partnership&quot;&gt;It’s a partnership&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our customers respond to designers and what they say, but it’s our tone of voice they trust so we translate them into that. It’s a mix of brand and retailer communication that works best.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;designers-add-stardust-use-it&quot;&gt;Designers add stardust. Use it&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Customers order through us but the designer sends the product out. We ask them to handwrite the envelope. It makes it really special. Beautiful packaging is a must-have touch today.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;talk-about-prices&quot;&gt;Talk about prices&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We work with designers on price. We’ll price match all year – including Sales periods. You don’t want to undercut your suppliers. Consumers are smart, they will find the other options if you’re overpricing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;use-data&quot;&gt;Use data&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I love a spreadsheet. Our biggest selling category is dresses, and we know we don’t sell see-through, tight or short pieces. That information is priceless. So we work with designers ahead of season and will tell them – you sold mostly blue, size 14 – we can look together and think about what they can do going forward.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Any store, whether online or not, should collate data on what’s sold, who to and how many returns they had.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;research-them&quot;&gt;Research them&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our buying is rigorous. Take Pure. Ahead of time we contact the new brands that are interesting and go and meet them at the show. It’s really important to meet in person – so they can see what we’re about and vice versa.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;vet-them&quot;&gt;Vet them&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We don’t want to waste our time or theirs so we filter all potential brands through a list and ensure they meet our criteria before we approach them.   &lt;em&gt;Paula Watson was talking to Sophy Searight in December 2015&lt;/em&gt; &lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="inspiration" /><summary>When it comes to supplier relationships, there’s a fine line between being too demanding and not demanding enough.

Customers prefer local. Author and lecturer Martin Butler explains why, and what you can do to boost your customer appeal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The future of retail is local! Not only does my global research indicate this… but Wal-Mart, the largest retailer on the planet, is on the record agreeing with it too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In fact, around the world, the biggest challenge the heavyweights is making their gigantic businesses genuinely relevant to local markets, local people, local feelings. That’s why convenience stores are the flavour of the month or why individual coffee shops are stirring things just the way customers like…nowadays people want to be ‘excited and delighted’ and they love it when you make it personal!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So for start-ups and small businesses the time couldn’t be better.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The modern customer loves localness, loves dealing with someone they know, someone they can relate to. While the big boys use algorithms, analysis and big data, it’s nowhere near the same as being served by someone who genuinely ‘cares’…. deep down, customers don’t like being treated as one-of- the-cloud.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So here’s my ‘High Five’ for small business success:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;chosen&quot;&gt;1 CHOSEN&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Understand you sell nothing that can’t be bought somewhere else.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even if it’s unique at the moment, it’ll soon be copied. So it’s not what you do, but it’s how you do it that’s the key to success.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Broadly speaking, customers are looking for solutions so you must always adopt a mind-set of being in the business of being chosen. No matter how different your particular dress design is, how flavoursome your pies are or how well you cut hair – you are just one of the many ‘solutions’ customers can choose.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fully embrace the fact that you’ll only be chosen, or repeatedly chosen, if you make the customers feel they are very special indeed…I call it ‘emotional edge’. By being authentic as well as emotionally based it should also make it more difficult for competitors to copy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;purpose&quot;&gt;2 PURPOSE&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Know very clearly why your business exists.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As Steve Jobs is believed to famously enjoy asking, you must be able to passionately explain to everyone and anyone ‘what wrong you’re going to right’ in this world. When you explain your purpose to customers they should be as excited as you and your teams are!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And guess what, if making money is your purpose there’s very little chance your customers will be as excited as you. Profits should only ever be viewed as an outcome – making you rich is certainly not the ‘reason’ a customer will chose you. 
Keep it passionate, and change the world for the better by knowing exactly why you and your business exists.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;human-beings&quot;&gt;3 HUMAN BEINGS&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hey big surprise, customers are 100 per cent human beings… so always keep it appropriate and personal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most importantly remember, according to various statistics, women control over 85 per cent of customer spending including 60 per cent of boys’ toys and incredibly they influence 70 per cent of male fashions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It doesn’t really matterhow accurate these actual figures are in your particular village, city or country - you get my point. When it comes to customers, women are significantly more important than the 51 per cent they represent numerically!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;trust&quot;&gt;4 TRUST&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Never ever, ever forget the most important point about human beings - no one is going to buy anything from anyone they don’t trust; certainly they won’t buy from them ever again if they can’t trust them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Trust is a feeling, an emotion and it has to be earned. So at all times view your business as being on the customers’ side in all its dealings. Do this and you will start to earn their respect and from this, over time, trust will develop…hey why not underpin your business with a proper ‘no quibble’ guarantee – and don’t be tempted to run your business for the 2 per cent of customers who’ll try to rip you off, 98 per cent won’t!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;easy&quot;&gt;5 EASY&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And as all customers are human beings please remember …we are hard-wired to ‘love’ easy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So in every way, every day, strive to make life as easy as possible for your customers. Success is all about developing a mind-set of ‘easy everything.’ Forensically look to remove all psychological and physical barriers to purchase. When a customer wants to browse in store or online, make it easy. When they want to buy, make it really easy. When they’re ready to pay make it really, really, easy!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No human being ever said, oh I wish they’d made it a bit more difficult for me!&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="in-store" /><summary>There’s good news for small retailers.

&lt;p&gt;Inside Retail hung out with her at Pure London. Here she shares her tips on team leadership, what makes a good buyer and how to buy for online versus the store.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;leading-a-buying-team&quot;&gt;Leading a buying team&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a team leader my job is to get buyers to think commercially and strategically but equally you have to excite the customer so we need those ‘out-there’ pieces in the collection. They help to sell everything else.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Buyers need to understand the customer base and look at the analysis, but also go for the things that inspire you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s important that our buyers are given autonomy to go out and buy and have the courage of their convictions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Where we want to retain staff but can’t promote them, we ensure they have ownership of a project and exposure to senior members of the team.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Showing that their opinion matters to the business is important. There’s not enough of telling them they’re valued and that they’re doing a great job.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;advice-for-junior-buyers&quot;&gt;Advice for junior buyers&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The new generation coming through understands their self worth and are go-getting, but at some point in your career you have to consolidate your experience otherwise you’ll get caught out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Know the basics of how to plan a range, how to range build from visual-, online- and customer-facing perspectives. Knowing those key basics in detail is something some people try to skip.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Understand the marketplace, that it’s a commercial business, and having passion will always be key.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can learn to be strategic over time. Experience will teach you to think further ahead of the next season and the repercussions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Buyers need to be conversant in the facts and figures. The relationship with merchandisers works in tandem.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;shopping-the-competition&quot;&gt;Shopping the competition&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Keeping an eye on the competition is a reality check. It’s important to shop everything from Primark to Prada to allow you to contextualise the position of your business.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We look at our competitors’ ideas, executions, new brands and new products. I love the visual and ways new areas are edited, and new suggestions around lifestyle.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The most exciting feeling is being inspired. If I’m inspired, my customer will be too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;buying-for-online-versus-the-store&quot;&gt;Buying for online versus the store&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The key difference when buying for multichannel compared with a store is that width and depth drive online sales. You can’t deliver that in the contraints of a store.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Online customer traffic comes through product searches as much as through brand searches. In store she’s a bit more brand focused and brand loyal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We ensure we have lots of online exclusives and really back what we think will be bestsellers because your customer base is so much wider.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You’re buying for the world rather than a specific area or locality, so you need to have that mindset.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;online-merchandising&quot;&gt;Online merchandising&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Online is easier than buying for store as it’s less visual. You don’t need to think how it will sit together and how the customer be enticed into buying that whole outfit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can be wider online. The customer is looking for choice, she’ll scan 100 options in two minutes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Understand she’s in a much different mindset when online than in a store.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="in-store" /><summary>Having worked at House of Fraser for more than 10 years Claudia Batistall has a wealth of experience as a fashion buyer and team leader.</summary></entry><entry><title>The ABCs of Creating a Successful Gifting Business</title><link href="http://inside-retail.garethjohnsdesign.com/articles/the-abcs-of-creating-a-successful-gifting-business/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="The ABCs of Creating a Successful Gifting Business" /><published>2016-07-18T22:57:00+00:00</published><updated>2016-07-18T22:57:00+00:00</updated><id>http://inside-retail.garethjohnsdesign.com/articles/the-abcs-of-creating-a-successful-gifting-business</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://inside-retail.garethjohnsdesign.com/articles/the-abcs-of-creating-a-successful-gifting-business/">&lt;p&gt;The Letteroom started life in 2009 by sometimes operating out of a bathroom. Since then founders Jackie Jackson and Sherrie Mead have grown the online gifting retailer into a 
a business with a raft of loyal customers and a full-time team. Here they explain how they did it and what they’ve learned along the way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;setting-up&quot;&gt;Setting up&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The duo met as parents with children at the same school working on a committee together. Jackson’s clipboard and organisational skills were spotted by Mead, who had recognised a gap in the market for personalisation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“I had been a casting director for commercials and a fashion stylist, so I’d always an eye for fashion and colour and always liked retail. This all melded together but I wasn’t very good at adding up and realised I needed a business partner,” says Mead.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jackson, meanwhile, had a background in fashion accessories buying and an eye for product. In early 2009 they raised a small amount of capital and by September were scouting for product.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;starting-with-a&quot;&gt;Starting with A&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jackson and Mead settled on lettered products as a focus for the business. “Personalisation was just coming to the fore and the idea of letters echoed this theme,” says Jackson. “People want something that tells their story.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The company now focuses on products that are ‘contemporary with a twist’ such as a personalised children’s train set, which remains a bestseller from the early days.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Autumn Fair has become a big date in the calendar. Jackson and Mead choose product together and put budget aside to take advantage of close-to-season.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“We are now nimble enough as a company to work close to the market as well as plan ahead. We can go to Autumn Fair and buy instantly if we want it, and buy with confidence if we see the right product,” says Jackson.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;milestone-moments&quot;&gt;Milestone moments&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Letteroom initially used Mead’s bathroom as its packing room and family would help out with daily trips to the post office to post packages.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An early milestone was the decision to invest in a Royal Mail service to come and collect parcels each time. “That felt fantastic,” says Jackson.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A bigger stepping stone was joining notonthehighstreet.com. Mead says: “Notonthehighstreet also saw the opportunity around personalisation. They were integral to our success. They elevated us and still do, giving us a marketing platform, an opening to customers and ideas. Our staff levels quadrupled.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;lessons-learned&quot;&gt;Lessons learned&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For Jackson, one of the things she would do differently now include putting in a stock control system. She adds: “We employed someone full-time for customer service after two to three years, but I would like to have had someone earlier, it frees you up to grow your business.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mead highlights to high a spend on the initial website as well as some ill-considered product choices as her lessons. “We didn’t think the whole journey of that product through in some cases, is it too heavy to send, will it smash? These are things you need to think about.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/uploads/gs-the-abcs-of-creating-a-successful-online-gifting-business.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;gs-the-abcs-of-creating-a-successful-online-gifting-business.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;top-tip-be-focused-on-your-customer&quot;&gt;Top tip: Be focused on your customer&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jackson advises: “At Autumn Fair have an image of your customer in mind. Narrow your search before you go, and know if you’re looking for something for the home, or for children. If you scattergun, you’ll come out with nothing.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;top-tip-be-ready-for-the-first-hurdle&quot;&gt;Top tip: Be ready for the first hurdle&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The buzz and fun in a business comes from the setting up, choosing a name and creating a website, notes Mead. But reality hits the moment you start going to trade shows. “That’s when businesses tend to fall and you will need to get over that hurdle.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;working-partnership&quot;&gt;Working partnership&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Both Jackson and Mead are also adamant that not going it alone has given them the confidence and capabilities to create the business they have today.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“[Having a business partner] gives you a sounding board and if have an off day, you know someone else is there. It would be lonely on your own, it’s a warm feeling and it’s important,” says Jackson.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mead agrees: “I’d recommend a business partner to anybody. We’re very different and alike at the same time. It shouldn’t all be serious either, there should be fun.”&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="ecommerce" /><summary>The Letteroom started life in 2009 by sometimes operating out of a bathroom.

&lt;p&gt;Here he shares his top 20 checklist for small and local business success:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;never-forget-customers-have-a-choice&quot;&gt;1 Never forget customers have a choice…&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;… so you’re in the business of being chosen.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;all-customers-are-human-beings&quot;&gt;2 All customers are human beings.&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Emotion plays a dominant role in decision making – so find your emotional edge.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;everyone-is-hard-wired-to-love-easy&quot;&gt;3 Everyone is hard wired to love ‘easy’…&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;… so make it easy for customers to choose you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;pick-the-battle-you-want-to-win&quot;&gt;4 Pick the battle you want to win.&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It might be expertise, or quality, or uniqueness, or outstanding service, or convenience or whatever. But avoid being dragged into price wars - the big boys always win.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-old-value-equation-was-simply-price-versus-quality&quot;&gt;5 The old value equation was simply: price versus quality.&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But now the ‘new’ value equation is: what I get versus what I pay… and here you can see the role of emotion. So stay clear of price, always go for value.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;nothing-is-more-appealing-than-being-different&quot;&gt;6 Nothing is more appealing than being different…&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;… so whatever battle you choose to fight, challenge yourself to ‘stand out’ by being as different as possible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;ensure-everyone-serving-knows-more-about-the-product&quot;&gt;7 Ensure everyone serving knows more about the product…&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;… than the customers. This is a non-negotiable prerequisite.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;always-remember-you-cant-get-the-wrong-person-to-do-the-right-thing&quot;&gt;8 Always remember you can’t get the ‘wrong person to do the right thing’.&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Be very, very choosy when it comes to hiring your workforce.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;happy-customers-are-more-inclined-to-buy&quot;&gt;9 Happy customers are more inclined to buy…&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;… so make sure you and your staff are happy!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;genuine-passion-is-your-most-appealing-feature&quot;&gt;10 Genuine ‘passion’ is your most appealing feature.&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There’s no substitute and nothing quite as attractive as this, presented in a memorable way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;authenticity-in-modern-business-is-essential&quot;&gt;11 Authenticity in modern business is essential…&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;… so is a grand ambition to be regarded as an ‘authority’.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-big-no-longer-eat-the-small&quot;&gt;12 The big no longer eat the small.&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nowadays it’s the fast who eat the slow. So live ‘speed’ in everything you do - customers will love you for it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;embed-an-imperative-to-say-yes-to-customers&quot;&gt;13 Embed an imperative to say ‘yes’ to customers.&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Become a positive ‘solutions’ business - even if it means losing an immediate sale by referring a customer elsewhere. Great local business is all about ‘giving a little of today, for a lot of tomorrow’. Eventually, you will become the trusted first stop for customers looking for the sort of solutions you sell.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;retail-and-service-companies-come-face-to-face-with-customers&quot;&gt;14 Retail and service companies come face to face with customers…&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;… so always learn from your customers. But if you ask questions make sure you listen deeply, and when you’ve listened deeply, always, always: ACT.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;elevate-customer-service-to-the-most-important-element&quot;&gt;15 Elevate customer service to the most important element…&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;… but always add emotion. That way you’ll end up with customer ‘care’ and it’s a great way to differentiate and be chosen.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;turn-a-complaint-into-a-fan&quot;&gt;16 Turn a complaint into a fan…&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;… when customers complain they’re in an emotionally vulnerable state. Whatever it takes, cure the complaint! Have a strategy for service recovery that’s all about keeping the complainant as a customer. You’ll be amazed how easy it is to gain fans.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;demand-killer-news-from-your-suppliers&quot;&gt;17 Demand ‘killer news’ from your suppliers…&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;… news that will help inform and ‘colour’ how you converse to customers. You’ll be surprised what’s out there if you ask. Customers will love and remember you for it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;always-offer-free-same-day-delivery&quot;&gt;18 Always offer (free) same day delivery.&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Go on, make it easy for your customers to buy from you. Same day delivery was standard for small, local businesses not long ago – bring it back now!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;use-digital-and-social-marketing-whenever-and-wherever-is-appropriate&quot;&gt;19 Use digital and social marketing whenever and wherever is appropriate…&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;… but be very, very clear, it’s all about building deeper, more emotional relationships not just selling stuff. Best advice comes from teenagers – true!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;and-finally-the-big-one&quot;&gt;20 And finally the big one.&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The one thing big companies find most difficult is to get customers to feel they ‘belong’. In truth the majority don’t even know who anyone is until they pay for something. This is the complete opposite for the smaller, locally run, businesses – so leverage this until the pips squeak!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Remember - you can never be too local when fighting for customers!&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="in-store" /><summary>Martin Butler is an author and lecturer specialising in how retail businesses can serve their customers better.</summary></entry><entry><title>Mindful Expansion</title><link href="http://inside-retail.garethjohnsdesign.com/articles/mindful-expansion/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Mindful Expansion" /><published>2016-07-18T16:03:00+00:00</published><updated>2016-07-18T16:03:00+00:00</updated><id>http://inside-retail.garethjohnsdesign.com/articles/mindful-expansion</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://inside-retail.garethjohnsdesign.com/articles/mindful-expansion/">&lt;p&gt;Aria Crafts expanded from a local hand crafts and toys supplier to focus on household products from ethically-sourced Balinese suppliers before its most recent development, the newly opened Happy Buddha in Bournemouth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Managing director Chris Kettle shares his story and tips.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/uploads/gs-mindful-expansion-aria-crafts-3.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;gs-mindful-expansion-aria-crafts-3.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-aria-crafts-story&quot;&gt;THE ARIA CRAFTS STORY&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Aria Crafts was founded in 1989 with an intention to supply traditional toys and local hand-made crafts from Wales.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Customer feedback indicated a demand for other unique and unusual products and as a result the range was expanded to include crafts from all over the world, with a particular focus on ethically-sourced products from Bali&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Growing demand prompted the company to set up online, and to develop a physical presence to put its product ranges directly in front of customers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This has growth through market stalls on the south coast of England and through outlets such as The Emporium in Christchurch specialising in Asian crafts, incense and aromatherapy and its newly opened Happy Buddha shop in Bournemouth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;chriss-key-lessons&quot;&gt;CHRIS’S KEY LESSONS&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;finding-suppliers&quot;&gt;1 Finding suppliers&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a ‘market trader’ one of our biggest problems was finding suppliers who were happy to supply us since we were not a traditional bricks and mortar retailer. With perseverance we eventually managed to source some of the best suppliers by providing pictures of our stands and showing our marketing skills for their products.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;product-choice&quot;&gt;2 Product choice&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the realities most retailers come to face at some point is the fact that some products that you personally like may not be what your customer wants (who is always right!)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;moving-stock-on&quot;&gt;3 Moving stock on&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When we find a certain line does not sell, we get rid of it. Full shelves of non-selling product is futile, selling space is valuable. Once you find your product mix always make sure you have enough stock (not excessive) to cover demand.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;financing-the-business&quot;&gt;4 Financing the business&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, do not overextend yourself financially. There are always hidden costs. Start small, reinvest, grow the business and profit will look after itself.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="in-store" /><summary>Aria Crafts expanded from a local hand crafts and toys supplier to focus on household products from ethically-sourced Balinese suppliers before its most recent development, the newly opened Happy Buddha in Bournemouth.</summary></entry><entry><title>How to Shake up a Sector… and Succeed</title><link href="http://inside-retail.garethjohnsdesign.com/articles/how-to-shake-up-a-sector-dot-dot-dot-and-succeed/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="How to Shake up a Sector… and Succeed" /><published>2016-07-18T16:01:00+00:00</published><updated>2016-07-18T16:01:00+00:00</updated><id>http://inside-retail.garethjohnsdesign.com/articles/how-to-shake-up-a-sector-dot-dot-dot-and-succeed</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://inside-retail.garethjohnsdesign.com/articles/how-to-shake-up-a-sector-dot-dot-dot-and-succeed/">&lt;p&gt; With its innovative digital take on the wedding gift business, Prezola, which launched in 2010, manages over 5000 gift lists a year.  Forecasting a £10m turnover in 2016, the business has scooped multiple awards including the Retailer of the Year gong at The Great British Entrepreneur Awards and the Wedding Gift List of the Year for 2016. It is run by Ali and Dom Beaven. Here, Dom reveals the steps to success.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;take-an-established-business-and-do-it-differently&quot;&gt;1 Take an established business and do it differently&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Prezola has taken a centuries-old niche business and revolutionised it for the iPad generation.  ### 2 Know your customer&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We target young, affluent, brand-aware couples and so it’s vital that we keep ahead of trends with the latest products, colours, styles and brands.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;comfort-them&quot;&gt;3 Comfort them…&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Taking design cues from social media platforms that our users were very comfortable with has certainly helped.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;and-thrill-them&quot;&gt;4 …and thrill them&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ultimately though, up-to-the-minute product ranges and constantly surprising our users with new and exciting products has been key.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;listen-to-them&quot;&gt;5 Listen to them&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We subscribe to the likes of trend bible and attend all of the key shows, but we also listen to our customers, giving them an easy platform to tell us what they love. If a product, designer or range is requested enough we know there’s an appetite to add it to our range.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;focus-on-product&quot;&gt;6 Focus on product&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We see our product range as central to our business growth; a curated blend of established favourites alongside new and emerging designers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;recruit-passion&quot;&gt;7 Recruit passion&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We rarely hire experienced ‘buyers’, preferring to add people to our team who have a real passion for interior design and homeware.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;recruit-diversity&quot;&gt;8 Recruit diversity&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our buying team is a mix of men and women spanning the newly-graduated through to mums in their fifties. Their combined passion for shopping means we’re always at the leading edge of trends.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;travel&quot;&gt;9 Travel&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our team of ten buyers attend the major trade shows throughout the UK as well as trawling smaller events like Tent London and Hackney market.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;change-your-product-mix-fast&quot;&gt;10 Change your product mix. Fast&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Market trends are also critical. Nutri-bullets and spiralizers were best-sellers in 2015 when we had no sales of these products at all in 2014.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;play-your-own-game&quot;&gt;11 Play your own game&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Be very good at something that’s needed and don’t lose your focus. You can’t beat the Goliaths at the scale game, so you’ll have to start a new game where you can win; whether that’s amazing customer service, innovative product ranges or a brand that makes customers feel special.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;remember-the-competition&quot;&gt;12 Remember the competition&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our biggest competitor is John Lewis and ‘beating’ them has never been an option. Nonetheless, we’ve been able to create a huge new business alongside them, acknowledging their strengths while creating our own.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="inspiration" /><summary> With its innovative digital take on the wedding gift business, Prezola, which launched in 2010, manages over 5000 gift lists a year.

&lt;h3 id=&quot;whats-my-starting-point&quot;&gt;1 What’s my starting point?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Decide your customer value proposition. What are you selling? What competition is out there including established stores-based retailer? Why should customers come and buy from you?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;do-i-need-a-business-plan&quot;&gt;2 Do I need a business plan?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A plan will help you document what you’re trying to do and work through your customer value proposition. It will help you work out the costs, how you will promote and market your product and what the opportunity is.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;how-will-i-know-if-i-have-a-good-proposition-or-not&quot;&gt;3 How will I know if I have a good proposition or not?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Gut instinct is normally the best barometer but also do your research. Talk to family and friends. If you encourage them to be, they’re likely to be the most open. You could also ask your own social media network if you’re happy to do that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;how-much-time-will-i-need-for-planning&quot;&gt;4 How much time will I need for planning?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That depends how you’re funding it. If you’re going to the bank, you will need to spend more time and put more rigour around the planning process. If not, you can be more fleet of foot and make decisions more quickly. You’ll probably need a good month or two to do a decent amount of planning.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;do-i-need-to-find-a-niche-to-be-successful-online&quot;&gt;5 Do I need to find a niche to be successful online?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Not necessarily. There’s not always a need to reinvent the wheel. Look at AO.com, it worked out there is a new and better way to buy an electrical product online. Could you come up with something similar for another retail sector?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;how-do-i-choose-an-ecommerce-platform&quot;&gt;6 How do I choose an ecommerce platform?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Think from a customer point of view. If you were buying, what customer functionality would you like? Try and buy products from other websites to give you a feel for the type of experience you want to offer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;how-much-will-it-cost&quot;&gt;7 How much will it cost?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are lots of cost-effective low-cost ecommerce platforms and solutions that can deliver against the experience and get you up and running for under £10,000. One mistake is to try to build the technology yourself. My view is it’s better to use what’s already been developed for the market.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="ecommerce" /><summary>Retail expert Martin Newman of Practicology answers your starter questions.</summary></entry></feed>
