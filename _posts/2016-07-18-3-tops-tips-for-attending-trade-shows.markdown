### 1 Prepare

Being at a trade show can be a bit like a deer caught in headlights; it’s vital to prepare, social networks and high end style blogs can be a great source of new product ideas. 

### 2 Filter

Finding new suppliers is not a big issue, it’s filtering them that’s important, ensuring you get unique and differentiated product.


### 3 Walk

You’ve got to be able to ‘sniff out’ the right suppliers at a trade fair, you’ve got to work hard and walk all the aisles, see how busy they are, how they approach you.
