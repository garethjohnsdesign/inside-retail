excerpt-text: Many millennials feel about garden centres the same way garden centres
  feel about social media – that it’s unknown territory, a language they don’t speak,
  not for them.
hero-text: "“Your millennial visitors will expect a good experience, memorable and
  sociable, with elements they can share on social media. They’ll reward you by posting
  pictures of what they’ve learned or created, and the great time they had, on their
  social networks.”"
length: One to two minute read
