Once you have your business strategy, how do you create a good supply chain? Notonthehighstreet.com CEO Simon Belsham says it’s all about clarity, partnership and communications.  

1. When looking at which suppliers to work with, network and research different types of partnership. Look for any reviews and accreditation to understand if they have particular strengths or skills suitable for your strategy. 

2. Be clear on what you want. Set clear expectations around quality, cost and also manufacturing. Do they have the capacity to produce the volume (big or small) you need?
Be clear when you negotiate. It’s not about one side winning, you both need to come to a place where incentivised for that relationship to work.

3. The relationship is the most important thing and it’s about give and take.  We call our 5,000 suppliers partners. Help them out if you can, and they will help you out should you need it.

4. Engage and communicate with your partners. It should be a two-way discussion and is just as important as talking to your customer. Go beyond email to share changes in your business.
