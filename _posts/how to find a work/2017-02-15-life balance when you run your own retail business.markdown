Opening your own shop is an absolute dream job for many. But just because you’re passionate about it doesn’t mean you’re suddenly immune to the demands of a seven-day daily grind and the sleepless nights that come with running a small business.

With staffing costs likely to be the easiest thing to cut down on when you’re starting out, it can be tough finding a work/life balance that doesn’t leave you feeling like you exist only to open and close the shop doors, cramming ideas, exercise, your family, friends and (god forbid!) a social life into those short hours in between.

So how do people make it work? Alex Fitzpatrick opened a vintage shop called [The New Curiosity Shop](https://www.facebook.com/TheNewCuriosityShopHereford/) in Hereford last July, swapping a high-pressure role as a commissioner for a local council for serving customers, antique hunting and a bit of consultancy on the side. The hours are long and the business is new, but Alex says she’s never felt better.

‘We decided to open the shop to reduce my stress levels and also to develop a career for my daughter. It has worked, because the stress of working all the hours God sends [in the shop] is nothing compared to working in an increasingly cash-strapped local authority trying to support vulnerable people,’ she says.

‘The best thing is being completely in control. We closed for a winter break [in January] and I went off to the Gower to clear out the cobwebs – a decision we were able to make at two days notice without asking anyone or worrying essential work was not happening because we weren’t there. And it was needed. We employ no other staff and worked 13 days straight up to Christmas, including a few late evening openings.’

Working day after day with weekends your busiest time can feel like you’re running on a treadmill of marathons with no means of jumping off. Alessandro Bonuzzi, with his business partner Tullio Nusca, opened [Woof Coffee](https://www.facebook.com/woofcoffee/) in Teddington, London last April. For the last nine months Alessandro has worked every single day, except Christmas.

‘I have been working every day. Every single day. It’s something I wouldn’t want for anyone else. It’s terrible. When you think about it it’s scary and terrible but the reality is worse. The good part is we only open 8am to 5pm. I used to work longer hours than this but at least I’m free in the evening,’ he says.

What does he do with those golden hours after 5pm? ‘I just go home and cook dinner. We started with a very small budget and until we reach a point where we can afford a payroll then we have to do the work ourselves,’ says Alessandro, a former sommelier and wine taster, who remains intensely passionate despite the slog.

‘I don’t find it stressful. But I don’t want to say it’s relaxed because that would be untrue. Working everyday becomes part of your bodyclock. Every morning at 7am I open my eyes, because the business is open at 8am,’ he says. ‘I don’t walk down the street as I used to, because you look at competitors, you know. Looking at the signage, advertising, products. You always think “how can I do what I do better?”’

That’s the thing about running a business like this: you have to be buyer, manager, marketing executive, brand developer and superhero - on top of ensuring the customer is always right, and that the machine delivers as it should. 

‘I’m always running ideas through my head,’ says [Anna Walker](http://www.annawalkerlondon.com/), a handbag and accessories designer and maker who first launched an online store, but has since had a series of pop up shops in London. ‘I take work home with me, but it’s usually the creative things that I’ll work: design, problem solving and research rather than admin or order fulfilment. It’s what I love to do so it doesn’t really feel too much like work! I often post things on social media when I’m technically not “at work”. There is a part of my brain that’s never not working.’

When not multitasking as ‘designer, production manager, sales person, PR, brand ambassador, etc’ Anna rebalances with the help of exercise and her support network. ‘I’ve recently taken up yoga which I am loving,’ she says. ‘I’ve never been very good at sticking to an exercise regime but I think that making sure that I dedicate time to my mind and my body every day is more rewarding than I ever thought it could be. Also my fiance and I are getting married later this year plus we are hopefully buying a flat so these are keeping [my priorities in line].’

Shaherazad Umbreen, the woman behind [18hourheels.com](http://www.18hourheels.com/), an online store that raises money for charity, while also holding down a full-time job as head of marketing at The Co-Op, is so enthusiastic about her sideline business that it keeps her buoyed up despite her busy schedule. She also employs freelancers to help her out on the day-to-day tasks that she can’t do while working. 

‘I have to be super organised to achieve a happy balance in life - and so far I have,’ she says. ‘It's stressful but it’s a really good kind of stress. When someone buys a pair of my shoes I dance with happiness. In a strange way, more stress equates to more happiness. Every pair of shoes sold supports the education of a woman or girl living in poverty.’

‘My business supported 500 women last year which makes me happy - but raises my stress levels somewhat as so many women are relying on me to sell shoes to help them. However, the benefit of running your own retail business is that you can fully control how much time you do spend. I commit to my time off with the same discipline that I commit to my work.  So, for example, when I go for a long weekend walk, I always leave my phone at home so that I am not distracted from my exercise.’
