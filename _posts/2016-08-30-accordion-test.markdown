    **Age Policy & Challenge 25**
    Our venues carry an age policy of "No under 16's, under 18's accompanied by an adult" - apologies to all you younger comedy fans out there.

    The Big Top and Apple Top are seated venues. We have two types of tickets in the Big Top - Front Stalls and Rear Stalls. The Front Stalls are allocated and positioned closest to the stage and therefore the action. All Big Top Rear Stall tickets and Apple Top tickets are sold as unreserved which means you can choose where you sit when you arrive.
