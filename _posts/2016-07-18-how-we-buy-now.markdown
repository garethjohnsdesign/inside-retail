How has buying changed? 

### 1 Shorter attention spans

The customer’s attention span is now shorter, there used to be a 13-week product cycle, now she’s bored after four.

### 2 Agile supplier relations

You need to trade together weekly with suppliers to be agile.

### 3 Multiple sourcing strategy

You have to buy for the channel, if you sell through wholesale and direct you need a dual sourcing strategy to manage big volume orders and in season drops.

### 4 Seasonless 

There aren’t really seasons anymore – just a financial half year.

### 5 Black Friday 

Black Friday changed the world, it has changed the shape of Christmas and you’ve got to do it.
