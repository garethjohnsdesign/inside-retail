Founded early 2014, and named after the owners’ favourite French town Aubeterre Blue was created with a vision to provide everything for successful home entertaining from a perfectly laid table, a well-dressed room or a garden party.

It does this through its website offer. 

Founder Piers Johnson explains the process they went through: 

### Wish list…

Both founders have experience in creating and establishing websites in a variety of industries.  When bringing that experience to retail, the first step was to create a wish list of criteria for what they wanted from the website. 

### Search and match…

They then looked for an existing platform provider that best met this, selecting Big Commerce. 

### Choice and set up…

The big challenges were making the right choices with third party providers, such as payment processing systems, banking partners and then managing the set up processes for each. 

### Last-minute challenges…

We had to change our payment processing partners just before launch due to misinterpretation of service and processes. In addition, setting up all the product lines in the back end was another mammoth job to complete.

### His top tip…

Work with partners. Wherever possible work with partners and experts, calling in favours and advice, as going it alone will be a daunting experience.
