We all know that an engaged, relevant social media audience a great place to start when it comes to making money in retail. There are several platforms you might want to consider and we know you have a very limited time to spend on them so it makes sense to focus your efforts on the ones that tend to inspire people to shop.

Pinterest is a great choice for many reasons, in our opinion. On the one hand it’s highly visual and allows you represent your shop’s personal style in a beautiful way. On the other hand, Pinterest’s users go there to plan the aesthetic parts of their lives. It’s an active community looking for inspiration as they, in many cases, decide what to spend money on.

According to Pinterest 75% of pins come from businesses and unlike ‘content with an ulterior motives’ on other platforms, that doesn’t annoy the users at all. They love ‘rich pins’ where they can see what’s in the picture, and where to get it.

> **Case Study:** Have a look at Pinterest’s [case study on Hillarys blinds,](https://business.pinterest.com/en/success-stories/hillarys) for some examples of what can be achieved if you go the whole hog.

1. To get started, [set up a business account](https://www.pinterest.co.uk/business/create/). It takes a few seconds


1. Set up your business profile – this is where pinners learn about your business and see your best content. You can add your logo and branding

2. Look into adding a ‘Save’ button to your pins and the Pinterest widget to your website. Both of these are free

3. You can track analytics, for free, from your business profile page – this is invaluable as a tool to see what products pinners love the most. Whether they live in your town or hundreds of miles away, this is a fascinating insight into what might sell well, and what to push on your other social media platforms.

4. Start a board and get pinning you photos. Each board should have a distinct theme that fits with your business’ personality.

5. Kick off with photos you already have of your business and brand and make sure your tags are spelt correctly and are completely intuitive and straightforward. Eg Don’t pick ‘Crimson’ instead of ‘Red’, you want you pins to come up in loads of searches.

6. NB: it doesn’t matter if you have followers. If your content is great, and properly tagged, everyone who’s looking for content like yours will find it.

Pinterest have a great webinar on their website which goes into great detail on how you can use Pinterest advertising and other services. It’s a long video so set aside some time, pen and paper at the ready, to gather information on whether Pinterest would be a good spend for you or whether you can get what you need for free.

Once you’ve grasped the basics I suggest [reading this article](https://business.pinterest.com/en/blog/the-retailers-guide-to-customer-retention-on-pinterest) with specific ideas for retailers on how to get your current customers spending more with you.
