Editor Sophy Searight was delighted to be given the opportunity to help create a new category within [Gift of the Year](https://www.giftoftheyear.co.uk/), especially for retailers. The Giftware Association and Spring Fair host Gift of the Year annually and it’s always a fabulous occasion, designed to recognise products and buyers who have had a fabulous year. This is the first year to include retailers and your opportunity for a prestigious award and some fantastic prizes.

Often, when we ask successful retailers for marketing or PR tips for their peers, they’ll mention that they aim to be shortlisted, and win, as many awards as possible. It can only boost your business.

The deadline is the second of January so don’t hang around!

**The background**

Celebrating the best in home and gift retailing, the Gift of The Year Awards are the most highly-respected industry accolades aimed at recognising the best new products and top retail talent.

2018 marks an exciting new era in the 40 year history of these prestigious Awards, as the Spring Fair and the Giftware Association join forces to offer a night of celebration at The Vox, part of the Resorts World entertainment complex, located adjacent to The NEC on Sunday 4th February. This awards night is hosted by celebrity compere **Rory Bremner**.

We’re looking to find the most exciting retailers and innovative new products available on the market in 2017/18.

Do you have what it takes?

“We were incredibly excited to be shortlisted and then to actually win was fantastic! We make sure to use the Winning icon on POS materials, which we supply to help retailers large and small display this GOTY ‘badge of honour’ to inform their customers about the product in question.

It certainly does bring some new customers who would perhaps not have had the product ‘on their radar' before.”  Designed in Colour
