For emerging brands, and retailers that have an online presence only, the concept of running an actual ‘bricks and mortar’ store can be daunting. Pop-up stores present a unique and creative opportunity to test location and new products, and give you a taster of who your customers could be, before committing to a lengthy lease.

Janine Dewey opened her first store in 2005, and with over a decade of experience as an independent fashion retailer, now runs her store as a pop-up store for 8-9 months of the year.
Janine’s passion for the fashion industry and commitment to her business, together with the support of her husband and a loyal team, has contributed to success of this unique business model.

O’Keefe Fashion is a unique fashion destination in Surrey with prestigious awards including Drapers Fashion Awards Finalist in 2012, Drapers Footwear & Accessories Finalist in 2013, and being voted 14th in Vogue’s top 100 stores outside London.

Janine explained that communication was a key aspect to the success of this business model, by ensuring her customers and the brands she collaborates with, are informed about the store’s seasonal operations. Janine utilises the additional quarter of the year to source new collections and new brands to keep things fresh for her customers. Her blog keeps customers engaged and inspired through photographs and experiences from her overseas trips.

By altering the way she does business, Janine’s decision to operate O’Keefe Fashion as a pop-up has paid off, with a loyal customer base who return not just for the great clothes, but for the personal service which includes genuine advice, special orders, home delivery and urgent alterations.

During the months she is not there, Janine leases out the store, enabling emerging brands and retailers across different industries to benefit from a unique experience to test new products and a new location.

So renting short-term retail space doesn’t have to be daunting, and there are plenty of opportunities across the country to seek out a pop-up location.
