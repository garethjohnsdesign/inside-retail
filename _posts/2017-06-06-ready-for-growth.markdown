Independent retailers across the UK face a host of challenges and obstacles each and every day which can limit growth potential and often leave you feeling unsure of what the best steps towards growth are.

Inside Retail has conducted research into over 200 retailers like yourself from across the UK and we’ve found there are some recurring key challenges to achieving your business ambition. These challenges often include;

1. Driving traffic to your website
2. Using social media to increase customer numbers 
3. Creating work-life balance, and good business time management
4. Driving footfall to your shop
5. Choosing products which sell fast at full price

To help address these issues and equip dynamic business leaders with the support they need to achieve their retail growth ambitions, we here at Inside Retail have teamed up with [G by Grant Thornton](http://g.grantthornton.co.uk/about-us/) to develop The Retail Growth Programme.
