# **Hello and welcome to Inside Retail**

I’m thrilled you’ve found us and I hope you like what we’re doing!

I’m Sophy Searight, Editor of Inside Retail. I also work with the research team for the UK’s biggest retail trade shows and as the team chat to 400 indie retailers per year, I get a fascinating, year-round view of the issues that the UK’s highstreet and online independent retailers are working with.

We know that starting, running and growing a retail business are all daunting tasks, and ones that have never been more complicated. We also know that the best advice on how to succeed comes from shops who are doing just that; so it’s their stories that we use on the site.

You will also find articles and analysis from retail experts, industry leaders and thought pioneers; all the ideas you need to make your business decisions easier, written by the journalists that write for some the UKs most respected publications.

The articles and guides on Inside Retail are commissioned especially for you and feature loads of interviews and advice from fellow indies. I hope they help inspire, reassure and support you in living the indie dream! If you’ve learned something important in your retail journey that you wish someone had told you before, please let me know because I’d love to chat to you about it, and maybe feature your shop on the site. I’m travelling around a lot in 2017 visiting retailers for Inside Retail; and there’s nothing I’d enjoy more than to come and see your shop!

Very best,

Sophy Searight
