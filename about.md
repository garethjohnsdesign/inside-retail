Aqualis represents the nature of experience itself. 

Aqualis fragrances are created to stimulate a familiar, blissful primal sense. 

While the senses map our experience of the world, a carefully selected fragrance can acutely dominate and lift ambience, in a tangible yet immeasurable way that we can only experience.

Aqualis fragrances unfold and transport the senses, not just to a field of roses, but to a universe of light and dark; of warm and cool; of beginnings and endings; of night and day. The true primal experiences that make us feel alive.

Evolution is the inaugural collection in the Aqualis range. 

EVOLUTION appropriately reverberates a story of evolution and time, and is made up of four fragrances; Origin, Utopia, Freedom and Coda. From the quiet of the early universe and the origins of light, to the closing passage of a musical piece, the names and artworks of these finely tuned fragrances track and provide a sensory journey. A step away from conventional perfumery, with a pioneering use of meticulously selected ingredients of the highest quality, the fragrances evolve on the wearer along with their own chemistry and environment.


Aqualis was founded by Steyn Grobler and Leonardo DellAgli. They combine a knowledge and vast exposure in the perfume and product design industries, and matched these resources with a shared passion to produce inspirational and stimulating consumer experiences through their fragrances. The very natures and spirits of the founders are embodied in the stunning fragrances, led aptly by the EVOLUTION collection.
