Social media is driving the retail conversation this Christmas and is firmly at the heart of big-budget campaigns from major high street players. In the lead-up to the big day, it can sound like there’s a lot of social media noise out there. For indies, the question is how to avoid being drowned out during this most crucial trading season.

Inside Retail spoke to a range of stores, online sellers and marketing experts to get the lowdown on how to create cut-through.  Here are their top tips on what to do (and what to avoid) for social media success this Christmas.

### 1 –  Join in the cultural conversation

There’s a good reason you’re hearing a lot of social media noise. From commenting on the latest Christmas ads on social, to sharing an entertaining video, people love to talk and share. Two-thirds of the UK population are active social media users, and we’re spending an average 1 hour 29 minutes each day on it across our devices.

Regardless of the size of your business, taking part in the cultural conversation and being reactive to hashtags and trending topics around Christmas can work well.

Online gift retailer Prezzybox went as far as making [a parody ad](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mZmEWRg5SNE) of this year’s John Lewis TV ad. “It was relatively easy to do, we had a dog, goats and a trampoline so we thought ‘why not?’,” says Fran Prince, social and marketing executive. By using the same hashtags, the retailer notched up 9,000 views on Facebook and 4,000 views on the day it was released.*separate paragraph*.

### 2 – Avoid too focus much on product
For most retailers, around two-thirds of annual sales take place during the Christmas selling season, so it’s no wonder there’s a temptation to just talk product, but that’s something to avoid.

“Small retailers often talk about their product and what they’re doing when in reality they need to be having a conversation with their customers,” says Amy Hobson, partner at SocialB. “People get bored of you talking about yourself.”

Instead talk about what’s relevant for your customers both on the national level but also personally. “Talk about how many sleeps there until Christmas, or the last order date for delivery. Use a simple graphic package like [Canva](https://www.canva.com/) to create posts,” she advises. “A children’s retailer could talk about nativities and plays, think about what will get your audience involved.”

### 3 – Inspire and be helpful

When you do talk about product, make sure it addresses all aspects and across all departments, including restaurants, says Chris Day, publicity manager of garden centre Buckingham Nurseries.

“People will expect to read about Christmas trees, lights and baubles however we've got to become a dream factor and a one-stop shop for ideas and inspiration. If you talk about
food, drink and gift ideas to connect to the non-garden centre audience, this will help widen expectations of your business.”

“For smaller indies to be heard over the bigger marketing investments my advice is to really engage with their customers and be helpful,” says SocialB’s Hobson.

When it comes to Christmas gift guides, this means offering customers solutions. Rather than just stating the best product or top tips for Dad, consider lists that are ‘for the man who has everything’.

For general retailers, there are plenty of opportunities to drip feed help around present choices – from what to buy pets to what to buy in a Secret Santa. Offering free gift wrap on orders placed by a certain time can also work.

### 4 – Use giveaways

“Life’s too expensive and everyone wants a discount,” says Sherrie Mead, co-founder of The Letteroom. Her advice? Give them what they want.

For The Letteroom this means doing giveaways for their followers on Facebook in particular. “Treat them like VIPs because they’ve taken the time to follow you.”

Chris Fox, head of design and marketing for greeting card and gift shop Wishes of Cudworth, agrees. “Facebook competitions are good for interaction, as opposed to your regular posts, so it’s a good idea to do this around your busy time. You get your regular Facebook fans to engage with your page, plus you can build upon that. A competition helps to get the word out.”

Buckingham Nurseries has also taken this approach. “Create excitement by running a simply shareable competition, the prize doesn't have to be expensive, but it does need to be relevant,” says Day.

Prezzybox runs competitions on Twitter together with its suppliers and partners. “It’s a way to gain followers and retweets and it can be scheduled on Tweetdeck so that it doesn’t take up too much time,” says Prince.

### 5 – Try out Facebook Live

Facebook Live is a new feature from the platform with huge potential for independent retailers. As its name suggests, Facebook Live allows you to broadcast, or live-stream, directly to an audience via Facebook. Unlike YouTube videos, which generally require direction and investment by retailers, Live videos are often more spontaneous with lower production values.

Wishes of Cudworth is one indie already experimenting with shop director Julia Keeling talking about [stocking fillers](https://www.facebook.com/wishesofcudworth/videos/1160775924012392/) in store or [live-streaming direct from a seasonal Sunday market](https://www.facebook.com/wishesofcudworth/videos/1168350633254921/) it took part in.

Other ideas for Live video content include showing the arrival of new stock, unveiling window displays or showing a pile of parcels ready to ship out. “Keep it short and sweet, no more than 90 seconds,” says Hobson. “It doesn’t have to be slick.”.

### 6 – Play to your strengths

Being yourself on social media is one of the greatest challenges facing indies but it’s also their greatest strength. “Smaller retailers are often scared to have a voice,” says Hobson. “But that’s what they need to communicate. Don’t be obsessed with the competition, look at your own customer base and why that customer would come to you.”

Things that make indies stand out could be offering personal giftwrapping, locally sourced product, or unique brands – whatever it is, indies should be talking about it on social media in their own way.

### 7 – Extend local connections

In the lead-up to Christmas, limited time means there is only so much smaller retailers can do. Experienced retailers advise forging stronger local to extend reach.

Buckingham Nurseries is this year working with the charity Medical Detection Dogs to link in with all its events and drive footfall, including a recent Christmas Taster Day. “Make sure all your other events and guests capitalise and piggy-back your efforts, encourage them to on social media and connect,” says Day.

Wishes of Cudworth has teamed up with the national event Homeless Christmas Shoebox Appeal to appeal on a local level. “As a shop you want to be in the hub of the community,” says Fox. “That helps to get people to organically share your likes. You’re helping a good cause plus yourself by aligning yourself with a good cause. It’s a win for everyone involved.”
