Independent retailers across the UK face a host of challenges and obstacles each and every day which can limit growth potential and often leave you feeling unsure of what the best steps towards growth are.

Inside Retail has conducted research into over 200 retailers like yourself from across the UK and we’ve found there are some recurring key challenges to achieving your business ambition.  These challenges often include;

1.	Driving traffic to your website:
2.	Using social media to increase customer numbers: 
3.	Creating work-life balance, and good business time management: 
4.	Driving footfall to your shop:
5.	Choosing products which sell fast at full price: 

This is why we’ve teamed up with [G by Grant Thornton](http://g.grantthornton.co.uk/about-us/) to help address those issues and equip dynamic business leaders with the support they need to achieve their retail growth ambitions.

Designed specifically for small retailers, G by Grant Thornton has developed The Retail Growth Programme in partnership with Inside Retail. The Retail Growth Programme provides you with the information and tools you need to expand your business. Through 10 structured growth workshops over 12 months, across core and optional subjects you will; gain knowledge and skills in these areas; understand best practices in the sector; and build your own plan to drive growth in your business.

Inside Retail and G by Grant Thornton will be onsite at Spring Fair to discuss your growth ambitions and understand your specific business challenges in mini growth diagnostic sessions, all completely free of charge!

To guarantee your time with one of the G by Grant Thornton experts at Spring Fair, make sure you book yourself in for one of our popular [‘Meet The Experts’](http://www.springfair.com/Content/Meet-The-Experts-Bookings) sessions being run throughout the fair. In addition to these sessions, G will be running two seminars on key topics - ‘How do I grow my business:  A Focus on Branding and Marketing’ with Lou Williams on Sunday, and ‘How to Grow Your Business’ with Azizur Rahman on Monday.
