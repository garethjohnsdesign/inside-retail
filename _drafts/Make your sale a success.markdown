Are you considering running a mid-season sale? Or an Easter sale, or a January sale, or any other sort of sale? Great – they can be a terrific thing as long as you bear a few practicalities in mind. A number of our retail contacts offered us some useful points:

### Do:

* Consider the idea of a loss leader, says Lyndan Orvis, Ecommerce Manager at [Hayes Garden World](http://www.hayesgardenworld.co.uk) (pictured). “Even if you sell 100pcs or 1000pcs it will often lead to additional purchases,” he says. “This item should be something that is required by everyone for broad appeal but not your core product so that customers have nothing else to buy from you. We often promote a garden bench or bird bath at cost or a small loss but our aim is for people to purchase a garden set with table or lounge suite. A bench is an additional purchase.

* Make your display attractive. “It is essential with any sale that we do that the furniture is set in a lifestyle dressing so people can envisage it in their garden,” says Orvis. “Do not stack it high and no boxes on the shop floor.

* Publicise with a campaign rather than a one-off: “In the build up to any campaign repetition in the advertising locally is vital: two weeks before sale put in a small ad,” advises Orvis The week before sale have a larger ad backed up by radio on the run up to the sale and maybe a leaflet drop. Higher priced purchases are a considered sale so people often plan ahead.”

* Tom Jeffrey, head of E-Commerce at apparel company [Jules B](https://www.julesb.co.uk/), adds that you need to watch your margins: “Our approach to a successful sale is really data driven. Our merchandising team take a seasonal approach with the aim to maintain a good margin and stay competitive for a higher return. We look at frequently purchased items, category promotions and lifestyle orientated, seasonal offers. We try not to go too heavy too quickly with further reductions to maintain as higher margin as possible.

* In the e-commerce world, if you have the resources, remember readers are individuals: “Seasonal artwork is created by our in house graphics team and updated to reflect the offers, further reductions and promotions available. This artwork is used across many platforms including segmented emails which are divided by brand and sent out to customers who we know have purchased those brands previously as well as similar brands we think they might also like. Sales are promoted across our social channels through our cover photos and daily posts which helps us create a sense of urgency and excitement around particular lines, offers or deals.

* …and continue this into the bricks and mortar world! “The physical stores tend to reflect the online campaign from the vinyls used on the windows, artwork and POS used through to pricing,” he says. “It's important to stay consistent for our customers so we try to keep the offers the same both online and in store.”

### Don't:

* Overcomplicate, says Orvis: “Do not complicate the extras. It is much quicker to convert the sale especially at a busy sale time.”

* Assume the customer will see the word “sale” and roll over onto their back. Orvis: “Customers are no longer open armed to a sale. They will be looking for over priced items and critical of false discounts. Purchasing for a sale with a view to still make full margin is a gamble. Cut your margin and give genuine value for money or your sale will not be a success. 

* Use a sale to clear out the old tat: if people didn’t want it at full price they may well not want it at a discount.

### Finally
Orvis advises that you need to have the right number of staff and the right number of goods. Pull staff from different departments if the alternative is to keep people waiting, and on product delivery remember lead times can be long, while customer attention span will be short. Don’t promise something that won’t arrive in time,

And good luck!
